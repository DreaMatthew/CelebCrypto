- reasoning: The tweet mentions 'Crypto Task Force' which is crypto-related, but no strong bullish or bearish signals were found in the text. The author (HesterPeirce, an SEC Commissioner) and high interaction metrics (394 likes, 77 retweets) were noted but don't change the neutral classification since the content itself lacks directional market signals.

- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: The tweet mentions SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (known as 'Crypto Mom' for her pro-innovation stance) and references an SEC email address, indicating regulatory context, but no strong bullish or bearish signals were found in the text itself. The author identity (SEC Commissioner) is crypto-relevant but the content is neutral directionally. Low interaction metrics (6 likes) do not strengthen any particular sentiment.
