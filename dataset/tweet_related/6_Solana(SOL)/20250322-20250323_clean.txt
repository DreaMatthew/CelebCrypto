- label: Bullish
- key_word_used: $SOL wallet
- reasoning: The tweet directly references Solana ($SOL) by asking users to provide their $SOL wallet for an NFT mint, indicating usage of the Solana blockchain.

- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet is a neutral comparison question between SOL and XRP milestones without expressing directional sentiment. High interaction metrics (Likes: 1671, Retweets: 470) from Cointelegraph were noted but do not change the neutral classification.
