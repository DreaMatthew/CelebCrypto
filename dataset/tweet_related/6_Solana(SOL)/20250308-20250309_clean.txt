- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: hard time
- reasoning: The tweet expresses negative sentiment toward Solana by suggesting startups building on it will face 'hard time' justifying their choice and that 'the tide is turning' against Solana in favor of Ethereum. No bullish signals were found. Metadata (398 Likes) indicates moderate engagement but doesn't change the bearish classification based on the direct negative commentary about Solana's prospects.
