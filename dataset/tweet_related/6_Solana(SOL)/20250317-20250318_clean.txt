Text: "Hot Take: This new @solana ad is actually brilliant marketing.

Everyone crying that “crypto is supposed to be decentralized and apolitical” is missing the point entirely. The ad is designed to be cringy rage bait, and you’re all taking the bait—pushing its reach even further. https://t.co/9QKgoafuoD"

Developer experience is worse

Developer tooling is worse

Uptime is worse

Explorers are worse

Data availability is worse 

Composability is worse 

Other than that though 👌"
