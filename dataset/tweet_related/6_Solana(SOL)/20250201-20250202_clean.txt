[ANALYZEDATA]
- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: rugs
- reasoning: The tweet directly questions Solana's quality by comparing it to BNB chain and highlighting '80,000 new tokens a day and most of them rugs' - this implies negative sentiment about token quality and ecosystem health. The 'rugs' keyword is a strong bearish signal indicating scams/failures. No metadata was used to modify this classification.

Solana only has 1 runner per day

Going to see the stock market go crazy on Monday with these Trump Tariffs

Text: "Genuinely the most interesting thing to launch on Solana since pump fun 

I have not sold a single coin since I bought at 6m 

Idc if it goes lower 

The market is wrong many times 

I’ll gladly ride to zero if I’m wrong that does happen sometimes"
