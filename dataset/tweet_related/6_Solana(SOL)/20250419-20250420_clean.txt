- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The author mentions Solana but only in the context of holding 'Fartcoin' as a joke investment, with no clear positive or negative sentiment about Solana's price or fundamentals. The overall tone is philosophical about risk assets rather than expressing directional sentiment about Solana specifically. Metadata was not used as no strong sentiment signals were present to strengthen.
