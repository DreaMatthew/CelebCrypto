- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found for Solana. The tweet mentions Solana in a comparative context with Cardano but doesn't express direct positive/negative sentiment about Solana's price or fundamentals. Metadata (high interactions) was noted but doesn't change the neutral classification since the core content lacks directional signals.

- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: Solana has 1000
- reasoning: The tweet directly compares Solana's validator count (1000) unfavorably against Ethereum (millions) and Hyperliquid (16), implying Solana is centralized or inferior. This comparison serves as a bearish signal about Solana's network security/decentralization. No metadata was used to influence the classification.
