Text: "WOW! While the rest of the market was melting, ‘e7f6c153’ just turned a 1.9 $SOL deposit into $800k! 🤯

Yes.. you read that correctly. His first significant win was $53k from a $700 bet, followed by a $90k win from a $3k bet.

He then proceeded to hit a $250k win from a $5k bet, https://t.co/SvluDEgvcq"

Text: "$SOL - You didn't listen to the blow off top. Didn't listen to waiting for the unlocks. Now the irony will be not listening to the buy signals when the selling stops. Don't rush it, maybe one or two more weeks then it's a much more appealing trade. Lower it goes the less risk. https://t.co/js5kRfTDxM"
