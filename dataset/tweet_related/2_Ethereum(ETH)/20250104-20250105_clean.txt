Text: "$SOL to $1,000 is one of those targets that sound ridiculously unbelievable until it happens

then it makes sense in hindsight

it's ironic that many expect $ETH to hit $10,000 but struggle to comprehend how SOL could hit $1,000

ETH at $10,000 will be $1.25 trillion market cap"

1) Fire 80% of non-dev and current leadership roles on the spot
2) convert the ETH left into a balanced basket of battle-tested LSTs
3) Cut 95% of current grants, especially ""run a node in Vorkuta"" initiatives
3) Instead of dumping"
