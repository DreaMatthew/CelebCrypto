- reasoning: The tweet describes selling Ethereum at a loss ($4300 purchase price, sold at $2900) to buy Solana, which then also declined significantly. This constitutes a bearish action signal (selling/swap) for Ethereum. No metadata was used to influence the classification as the core text clearly indicates bearish sentiment through the selling action.

The mention of specific ETH price levels indicates price discussion relevant to the theme. No metadata was needed to determine the bullish sentiment as the price comparison itself provides clear directional bias.

The tweet mentions ETH movements between exchanges but expresses uncertainty ('what the hell they are doing behind the scenes') rather than clear positive or negative sentiment. Metadata (high interactions: 1642 Likes, 313 Retweets) was noted but does not change the neutral classification due to lack of directional signals.
