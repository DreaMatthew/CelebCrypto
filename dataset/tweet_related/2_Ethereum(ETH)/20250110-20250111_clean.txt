- label: Bullish
- key_word_used: Ethereum Price 2023, 2024 & 2025
- reasoning: The tweet directly discusses Ethereum price predictions for multiple years (2023-2025), which constitutes meaningful price discussion. The forward-looking nature of multi-year price analysis typically implies bullish sentiment about future price appreciation. No metadata was needed to determine sentiment as the price prediction context itself provides the bullish signal.
