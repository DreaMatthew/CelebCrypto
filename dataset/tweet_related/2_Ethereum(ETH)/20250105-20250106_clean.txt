- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet uses Ethereum's market cap as a comparative benchmark for Dogecoin but does not express any direct sentiment about ETH's price, technology, or future prospects. The metadata (high interactions) was noted but does not change the neutral classification since the core content lacks directional sentiment signals.
