Sell all $ETH into $SOL and $SUI as they try and prop up  $ETH. $ETH is the biggest risk to crypto. Its old, clunky, broken and cant be trusted to hold value. This hack will simply be duplicated again and again until all L2 multisigs are compromised."

Text: "ELI5 why we cannot ""rollback"" Ethereum?

After yesterday's Bybit hack, crypto commentators are again asking why Ethereum cannot ""rollback"" the chain to reverse the hack. 

While experienced ecosystem actors near-unanimously agree that this is infeasible, it's worth breaking down"

Metadata (high interactions) was noted but doesn't change the neutral classification since the content itself lacks directional sentiment signals.
