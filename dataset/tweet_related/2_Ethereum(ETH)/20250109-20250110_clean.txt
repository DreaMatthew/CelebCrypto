Text: "People tried to dunk when $BTC was sub $250 in 2015, when $ETH was sub $100 in 2018, when $SOL was sub $10 in 2022 and now the same with $TIA sub $5. 

All will share one thing in common:  wasting their breath, while blowing a generational opportunity. 

$BTC @ $250 = $5.3B FDV"

[ANALYZEDATA]
- label: Bullish
- key_word_used: generational opportunity
- reasoning: The tweet directly references Ethereum's historical price ('$ETH was sub $100 in 2018') and uses bullish language describing current price levels as a 'generational opportunity' while criticizing those who doubted previous low prices. No metadata was needed to determine the bullish sentiment as the text contains clear positive signals about long-term potential.
