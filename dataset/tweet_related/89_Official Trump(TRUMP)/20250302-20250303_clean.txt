- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet mentions $trump but uses speculative/questioning language ('over under') and describes the situation as 'hilarious' rather than expressing clear price sentiment. Metadata was considered but did not provide strong directional signals.

A gift to Brad for giving #Tump the memecoin economics behind $TRUMP 

#Bitcoin is all that really matters. 

The rest is about attracting crypto projects to America to create jobs."

- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet mentions TRUMP as part of a portfolio allocation discussion (0% allocation), but contains no explicit price action signals, trading recommendations, or sentiment indicators about the asset itself. High interaction metrics (4134 likes, 165 retweets) indicate engagement but don't change the neutral classification since the content lacks directional sentiment.
