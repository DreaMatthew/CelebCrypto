Text: "Honestly think the Trump family extracted so much money from the $TRUMP + Melania token launches he honestly doesn’t care anymore

- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: extracted so much money
- reasoning: The tweet directly discusses $TRUMP token launches with negative sentiment, suggesting the Trump family has already extracted value and doesn't care about negative consequences. The phrase 'extracted so much money' indicates profit-taking behavior, which is a bearish signal. High interaction metrics (503 likes, 29 retweets) strengthen this bearish classification.
