Text: "The whale who once made ~$108M on $TRUMP lost $207K in just one hour yesterday.

He spent 5M $USDC to buy $TRUMP right after @realDonaldTrump posted “I LOVE $TRUMP,” then sold an hour later—taking a $207K loss.

This is the same whale who previously spent 1.09M $USDC to buy 5.97M https://t.co/uOAzhPgkVM"

- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet simply lists TRUMP among other altcoins without any price action commentary, sentiment indicators, or directional calls. Metadata (high interactions) indicates popularity but doesn't change the neutral classification since the content itself lacks sentiment signals.
