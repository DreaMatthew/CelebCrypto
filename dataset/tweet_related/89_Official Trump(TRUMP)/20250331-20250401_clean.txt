Text: "So many traders entertained the idea of $TRUMP launch being a sign of market top, not many actually risked off and stayed their hand since then. 

Lesson = the differences are made the in expression, not the ideas."

- key_word_used: market top
- reasoning: The tweet discusses TRUMP token launch as a potential 'market top' signal, which is a bearish indicator suggesting price peak. No metadata was used to influence the classification as the core text clearly indicates bearish sentiment about the asset's market timing.

[ANALYZEDATA]
- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: short
- reasoning: The tweet contains a clear bearish signal with the word 'short' indicating intention to bet against the asset. The author explicitly states 'Will short this to zero before the unlock' and mentions a large token unlock amount ($409M), which is typically viewed negatively. Metadata was considered but did not change the classification as the text contains strong direct bearish signals.
