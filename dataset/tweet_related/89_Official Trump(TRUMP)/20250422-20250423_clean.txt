Text: "Imo $TRUMP changed the game forever. It was like crypto doomsday- apocalyptic. Like some great tsunami wave engulfed our entire space. We were swallowed up whole.

Text: "Crypto is exploding now.

In 2025, I:
- Was one of the first to buy $TRUMP and sell the top for $25 million
- Shorted inauguration @ $110k
- Sold shorts @ $75k
- Longed $BTC $SOL $XRP #Fartcoin at the bottom

And documented everything publicly in real time.

My next move 👇 https://t.co/1QsdrvB091"
