- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet simply lists $TRUMP among many other symbols for which charts were posted, without any price action commentary, sentiment indicators, or directional language. Metadata (high interactions) was noted but doesn't change the neutral classification since the content itself lacks sentiment signals.

Text: "Unpopular opinion.

I think memes are done already.

$TRUMP was the top signal for memes.

Memes are the only thing to go on parabolic runs so far this cycle, and there isn't going to be a bigger and more hyped meme than $TRUMP, ever.

Memes have reached the pinnacle of hype."
