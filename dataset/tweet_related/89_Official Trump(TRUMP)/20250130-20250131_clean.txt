[ANALYZEDATA]
- label: Bullish
- key_word_used: whale
- reasoning: The tweet mentions a '$TRUMP whale' retiring, which in crypto context typically indicates a large holder selling their position - a bearish signal. However, the celebratory tone 'congrats' and the fact this is the second time suggests this might be viewed positively by the community as reducing selling pressure. The high engagement (345 Likes, 70707 Views) strengthens this interpretation as community sentiment.
