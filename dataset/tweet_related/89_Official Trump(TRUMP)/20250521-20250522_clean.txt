Text: "Well I guess it’s time to public about this all.

Yes the same wallet I am trading also had an unrealized profit of 45m on $trump at one point and is all the way down to 1.5m.

Welcome to the casino.

Still made enough on other wallets to retire but yes I’m a retard too."

- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: all the way down to 1.5m
- reasoning: The tweet shows a dramatic decline in unrealized profits on $TRUMP from 45m to 1.5m, indicating significant price depreciation. The phrase 'all the way down to 1.5m' serves as a strong bearish signal. No metadata was used to influence this classification as the content itself clearly demonstrates negative price performance.
