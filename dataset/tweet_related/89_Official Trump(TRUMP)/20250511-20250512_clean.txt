Text: "Over the past 4 months I gave my subscribers: 🧵 

-$300,000+ of $TRUMP
-$250,000+ in cash USDC/USDT/SOL
-$150,000+ in random marketing memecoins

In return, I get outsiders that talk bad 
making up lies &amp; rumors

If you’re around me please don’t be a sheep, be a leader 🫡 https://t.co/ZM2j6mEk48"
