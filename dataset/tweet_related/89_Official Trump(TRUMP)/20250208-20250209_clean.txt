- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: down to $30K
- reasoning: The tweet mentions $TRUMP as one of the purchased coins but shows a significant loss from $50K to $30K, indicating poor performance. No metadata was used as the bearish signal comes directly from the text showing substantial value decline.
