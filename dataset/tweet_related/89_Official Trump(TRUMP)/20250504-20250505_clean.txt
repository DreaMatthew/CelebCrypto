Text: "@Acyn Trump: launches his own crypto, promotes it, monetizes his name

Also Trump: “I haven’t even looked.”

It’s the same old deflection, grift wrapped in gaslighting, with a side of “But Pelosi!” to distract from the scam. 

$TRUMP isn’t currency. It’s cult merch."

- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found for TRUMP specifically. The tweet mentions TRUMP as one of several memecoins but the advice given is to buy BTC instead, which doesn't provide clear directional sentiment for TRUMP. Metadata was considered but didn't change the neutral classification.
