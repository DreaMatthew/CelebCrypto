- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet simply poses a choice between $PEPE and $TRUMP without expressing directional sentiment about either asset. Metadata (high interactions) was noted but doesn't change the neutral classification since no price sentiment was expressed.
