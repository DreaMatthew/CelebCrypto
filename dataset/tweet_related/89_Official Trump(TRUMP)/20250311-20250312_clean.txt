- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: (-36.7%)
- reasoning: The tweet directly mentions $TRUMP asset with a significant negative performance (-36.7%) over the last month, which serves as a strong bearish signal. The overall context frames Trump-related investments as poor performers and questions their legitimacy. High interaction metrics (900 likes, 209 retweets) strengthen the bearish sentiment's reach and impact.
