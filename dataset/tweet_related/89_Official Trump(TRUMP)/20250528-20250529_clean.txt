- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: shoved into your bleeding assholes
- reasoning: The tweet contains strong bearish sentiment through violent, negative imagery describing $TRUMP being forced upon people in a painful manner. No metadata was needed as the text alone provides clear bearish signals through the aggressive negative framing of the asset.
