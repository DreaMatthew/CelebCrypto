- key_word_used: lower highs / lower lows
- reasoning: The tweet contains bearish technical analysis signals ('lower highs / lower lows for ~2 months') indicating a sustained downtrend. While it mentions potential exhaustion of the bear trend, the primary signal is bearish. High interaction metrics (1347 Likes, 74 Retweets) strengthen the classification, though the author identity was not a key factor.
