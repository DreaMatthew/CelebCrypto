They are also dumping $ETH as we speak.

Text: "I'll be honest, I misread the outcome when $TRUMP launched as it being a precursor to a liquidity tidal wave for Solana. Instead it bred more ""hyped insider"" launches with the primary purpose to ""max extract."" It also made launching coins with obscure narratives not taboo.
