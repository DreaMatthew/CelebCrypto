- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: demands
- reasoning: The tweet discusses the TRUMP memecoin and mentions regulatory scrutiny (Ranking Member demanding release of guest list), which carries negative implications. The word 'demands' in the context of government investigation signals potential regulatory pressure. No metadata was used to strengthen the classification as the author is a government entity rather than the project itself.
