- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet discusses a hack on Bybit exchange and compares community reactions across different cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana), but does not contain direct price sentiment signals about Bitcoin's price, technology, or market outlook. Metadata was not used as the core content lacks sentiment indicators.
