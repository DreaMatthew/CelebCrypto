- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet humorously references a traditional finance friend calling Bitcoin 'worthless' but presents it as a joke rather than genuine bearish sentiment. The author's response 'I know... But let's hear it anyway' suggests this is ironic commentary rather than actual price sentiment. Metadata was not used as no clear directional signals were present.
