[ANALYZEDATA]
- label: Bearish
- key_word_used: no new money in circulation
- reasoning: The tweet discusses Bitcoin's price cycles in relation to money supply growth, showing dramatically reduced growth for the 2025 cycle (0.5% vs previous cycles of 22-49%) and explicitly stating 'no new money in circulation' - a strong bearish signal indicating lack of monetary fuel for price appreciation. High interaction metrics (4141 Likes, 335 Retweets) strengthen the bearish sentiment's reach and impact.
