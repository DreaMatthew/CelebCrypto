- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet discusses Ross Ulbricht's historical connection to Bitcoin and his pardon story, but contains no direct price action, investment advice, or market sentiment indicators. Metadata shows high engagement but doesn't alter the neutral classification since the content lacks market sentiment signals.

They launder money in cash.

Therefore, we need to sentence every chair of the Federal Reserve to life in prison.
