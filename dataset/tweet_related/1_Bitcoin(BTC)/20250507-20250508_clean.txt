- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. While Bitcoin is mentioned in a list of cryptocurrencies, the tweet lacks specific price, news, technology, or sentiment indicators about Bitcoin. The content is primarily celebratory/promotional without directional market signals. High interaction metrics were noted but do not change the neutral classification due to absence of market sentiment signals.
