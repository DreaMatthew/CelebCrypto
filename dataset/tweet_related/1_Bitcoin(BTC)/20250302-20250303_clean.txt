- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet mentions BTC and ETH but provides no directional sentiment about price, news, or fundamentals. The phrase 'stop hyperventilating' suggests calming down from previous excitement or panic, indicating a neutral/consolidation stance rather than clear bullish or bearish sentiment. Metadata was not used as the content itself lacked strong directional signals.
