- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found for Dogecoin specifically. While DOGE is mentioned among other memecoins, the advice given is to buy Bitcoin instead, which doesn't express clear positive or negative sentiment toward Dogecoin itself. Metadata was considered but didn't change the neutral classification.
