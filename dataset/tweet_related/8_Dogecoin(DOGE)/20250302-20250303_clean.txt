- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet mentions Dogecoin as part of a portfolio allocation (1.4%) but contains no explicit price sentiment indicators like 'buy', 'sell', 'rally', or 'dump'. The metadata (high interactions with 991 likes and 72 retweets) shows engagement but doesn't change the neutral sentiment classification.

Text: "Something that Bitcoiners will never tell you is that if you entered crypto at almost anytime between 2014-2021, you should have bought Dogecoin instead of Bitcoin. If you entered crypto in 2015, and you held until today, and you bought Bitcoin, then you bet on the wrong horse. https://t.co/cVu3VWeZIg"
