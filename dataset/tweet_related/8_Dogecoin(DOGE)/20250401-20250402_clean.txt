- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the tweet text. The mention of $DOGE appears to be incidental tagging rather than meaningful discussion about Dogecoin's price, technology, or market sentiment. The core content focuses on Social Security system issues, not cryptocurrency analysis. Metadata was not used as no clear sentiment signals were present.
