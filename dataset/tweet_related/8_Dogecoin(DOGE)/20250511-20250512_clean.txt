Today alone $DOGE added $9.4 Billion to its MC.

Do you really think $DOG can’t add $9.4 Billion?

Text: "People who bought DOGECOIN at a $5B market cap last bull run were - somehow 
- still early.
It 18x’ed from there to $90B.

$DOG is at $370M today. On Bitcoin. No inflation.
Do you even grasp how tiny that is in comparison? Even just 10% of DOGE’s run would be absurd for people"
