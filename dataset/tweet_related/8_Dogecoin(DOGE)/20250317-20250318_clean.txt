- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. While DOGE is mentioned (0% allocation), there are no direct price action signals, sentiment indicators, or calls to action regarding Dogecoin. The metadata (high interactions) does not change the neutral sentiment as the content lacks directional sentiment about DOGE specifically.
