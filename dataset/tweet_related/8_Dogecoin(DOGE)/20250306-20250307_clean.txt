- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet mentions Dogecoin among many other cryptocurrencies in a general discussion about a hypothetical 'U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve,' but contains no price action signals, investment advice, or sentiment indicators about DOGE specifically. The high interaction metrics (4051 Likes, 657 Retweets) indicate engagement but don't change the neutral classification since the content itself lacks directional sentiment.
