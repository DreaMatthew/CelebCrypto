Text: "MY TAKE ON $DOGE IN 2025 🐕🚀🌖 

Most people like to compare what $DOGE did in 2021 to what they think it will do in 2025. 

I like to take a more realistic approach even if I do seem a bit reserved in my predictions when it comes to $DOGE 

I’m sure you guys want me to say https://t.co/hJeMUnKf4Z"

Text: "The Dogecoin official X account posted a $CRYPTO video 2 days ago, removing our branding.

They tried to use it to market their own 37B mcap coin.

I called them out for it.

When I woke up this morning, they had deleted the video and my X DMs were broken."
