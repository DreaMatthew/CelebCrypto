- key_word_used: flip
- reasoning: The tweet contains bullish sentiment through the phrase '$DOG will flip $DOGE' which implies DOGE will be surpassed, suggesting bearishness for DOGE. However, since the theme is specifically about Dogecoin (DOGE) and the tweet directly discusses DOGE's position relative to another asset with a competitive tone, it shows negative sentiment toward DOGE's future prospects.
