- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found in the text. The tweet poses a hypothetical question about Dogecoin's potential future status versus a new currency, but contains no direct price action signals, investment advice, or news. Metadata (likes, retweets) was considered but did not change the neutral classification since the core content lacks directional sentiment.
