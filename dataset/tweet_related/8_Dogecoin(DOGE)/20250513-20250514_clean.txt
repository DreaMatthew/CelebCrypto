- key_word_used: 🚀
- reasoning: The tweet includes DOGE in a market cap comparison and uses the rocket emoji 🚀 (a bullish signal) while promoting $GIGA as 'the easiest play'. Although the primary focus is on $GIGA, the inclusion of DOGE in the market cap analysis and the overall bullish sentiment with the rocket emoji makes it relevant and bullish for DOGE by association.
