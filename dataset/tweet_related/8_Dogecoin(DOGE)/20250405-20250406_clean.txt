- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: The tweet mentions DOGE in a list of US-based cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap but contains no strong bullish or bearish signals specifically about Dogecoin. The bullish question refers to US-based projects in general for 2025, not Dogecoin specifically. No metadata was used to influence the classification as no strong directional signals were found.
