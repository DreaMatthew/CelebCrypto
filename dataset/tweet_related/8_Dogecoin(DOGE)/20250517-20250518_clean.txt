Text: "Awesome to see @RaoulGMI and @osf_rekt discuss the $XRP chart on REKTVISION yesterday @RealVision . Thank you.

“That $XRP chart is something to behold”

Then going onto discuss $DOGE / $BTC.

Both $XRP and $DOGE are going to benefit from the launch of F-Assets on @FlareNetworks https://t.co/PCVpGhYKMt"

Text: "~ @binance is listing $NXPC - @MaplestoryU — but this one's different.

No farming. No public sale. Just a big thank you to real memecoin holders.
If you’ve held $DOGE, $SHIB, $PEPE, $WIF, $ORDI or $BOME, you might already be eligible.

• 100M $NXPC (10% of supply) being https://t.co/yXcR0PeQUZ"
