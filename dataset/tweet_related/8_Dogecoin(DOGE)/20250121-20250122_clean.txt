- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: The tweet mentions DOGE but only in a comparative context with SHIB, asking users to choose between the two. No strong bullish signals (like 'buy', 'rally', '🚀') or bearish signals (like 'sell', 'dump', 'crash') were found in the text. The metadata (high interactions) indicates engagement but doesn't change the neutral sentiment, as the core content lacks directional price sentiment.
