- label: Consolidation
- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found. The tweet mentions Dogecoin in a comparative ranking context but contains no direct price sentiment indicators like 'buy', 'sell', 'rally', or 'dump'. The mention is factual reporting of Cardano outperforming Dogecoin in voting, without explicit negative or positive sentiment toward Dogecoin's price. Metadata was not used as the core text lacked sentiment signals.
