- reasoning: The tweet directly mentions Dogecoin in the context of Grayscale ETF applications, which is a significant institutional development. The primary signal is the explicit mention of 'Dogecoin' in relation to ETF filings. While the author (Cointelegraph) is a major crypto news outlet and the high interaction metrics (990 likes, 173 retweets) strengthen the significance, the core bullish signal comes from the institutional ETF application news itself.
