- key_word_used: N/A
- reasoning: No strong Bullish or Bearish signals were found for Dogecoin specifically. The tweet mentions DOGE in a comparative context with FLOKI but doesn't express direct price sentiment about DOGE itself. The author identity and high interaction metrics don't change the neutral classification since the focus is primarily on FLOKI rather than DOGE price action.
