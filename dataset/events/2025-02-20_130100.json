    "content": "Decentralized derivatives exchange SynFutures has introduced Synthia, an AI trading agent that allows traders to swap or transfer assets using natural language commands.\n\nSynFutures is the largest DEX on Coinbase's layer-2 network Base with 24 hour volume hitting $220 million and liquidity at $768 million.\n\nThe AI agent will be rolled out in three phases, the first of which will include integration on social media platform X and the ability to respond to basic commands like \"swap 100 USDC for ETH.\" The second phase will allow traders and developers to deploy AI agents to specific needs including futures trading and liquidity management.\n\nThe third and final phase is the introduction of a \"meta agent\" which is capable of creating and managing multiple agents in order to manage complex workflows and trading strategies.\n\nThe use of AI in trading is nothing new, a report last year estimates that around 65% of all equities trading is executed by algorithms. But the ability to deploy AI has the potential how traders interact with blockchain trading and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\n\"Our vision extends beyond this launch—we plan to develop a framework that will fundamentally transform how users interact and integrate with the onchain economy,” said Rachel Lin, co-founder and CEO of SynFutures.",
