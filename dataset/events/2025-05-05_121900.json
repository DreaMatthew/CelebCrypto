    "content": "Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Strategy (MSTR) added modestly to its bitcoin holdings last week.\n\nThe company purchased 1,895 BTC for $180.3 million, or an average price of $95,167 each, according to a Monday morning SEC filing.\n\nThe buys were funded via sales $128.5 million of common stock and $51.8 million of STRK preferred stock. The common stock sale notably used up the remainder of MSTR's 2024 $21 billion at-the-market offering. MSTR last week introduced a new $21 billion ATM offering.\n\nStrategy now holds 555,450 bitcoin purchased for $38.08 billion, or an average price of $68,550 each. At bitcoin's current price around $94,000, the holdings are worth north of $52 billion.\n\nMSTR is lower by 2.7% in premarket action.",
