    "content": "Hut 8's (HUT) new subsidiary, American Bitcoin Corp., a partnership between the mining company and the Trump family, could be spun out, allowing the company to focus on data center hosting, broker Clear Street said in a report Monday.\n\nThe broker noted that the new unit will be included in the bitcoin miner's financials, but the \"businesses could be separated, allowing HUT to focus on high-margin data center hosting revenue.\"\n\nHut 8 is expected to secure more power and expand its data center hosting business, the report said, and the \"potential to secure a hyperscaler\" is a key catalyst for the company.\n\nEric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are merging their firm, American Data Centers, with American Bitcoin, a new mining venture, taking a 20% stake in the company. The remaining 80% will be owned by Hut 8, which is contributing almost 61,000 mining machines to the new entity.\n\nCore Scientific's (CORZ) deal with cloud computing firm CoreWeave led to a re-rating of the sector last year, as investors warmed to the idea of bitcoin miners pivoting to artificial intelligence and high performance computing (HPC).\n\nHut 8 is projected to enter a phase of considerable growth, starting in the second half of the year, \"driven by the energization of the BITMAIN Colocation agreement,\" the report added.\n\nClear Street has a buy rating on Hut 8 shares with a $23 price target. The shares were over 4% higher at $12.10 in early trading.\n\nInvestment bank KBW noted that Eric Trump will serve as the chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, which could be a large positive given his \"commitment to the industry as well as his obvious relationships.\"\n\nKBW has an outperform rating on the stock with a $30 price target.",
