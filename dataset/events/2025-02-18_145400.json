    "content": "The second-largest publicly traded corporate bitcoin holder, MARA Holdings (MARA), has announced the completion of the acquisition of a wind farm in Texas, adding 114 megawatts of nameplate wind capacity and 240 megawatts of interconnection capacity to its operations.\n\nThe Florida-based company plans to use the wind farm to power bitcoin mining operations using last-generation ASIC mining hardware “that would have otherwise been written off or sold into the secondary market.”\n\nMARA noted that repurposing the machines and leveraging renewable energy will reduce bitcoin mining products costs while using wind power that might have otherwise gone unused.\n\n“With this added renewable energy asset, MARA now owns and operates 136 megawatts of generating capacity,” CEO Fred Thiel said in an announcement.\n\nMARA is the second-largest publicly traded corporate bitcoin holder, with 45,659 BTC on its balance sheet.",
