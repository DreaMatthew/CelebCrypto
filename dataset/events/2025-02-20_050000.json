    "content": "Layer 1 blockchain MANTRA has launched a startup accelerator program aimed at advancing the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), with backing from Google Cloud.\n\nThe initiative, dubbed RWAccelerator, offers startups funding, expert mentorship, AI-driven resources and technical support as they build solutions in sectors like real estate, financial products and alternative assets, the companies announced at Consensus Hong Kong.\n\nThe RWAccelerator comes at a pivotal time for the tokenized asset space. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2027, 10% of the world’s GDP — around $10 trillion — could be stored on blockchain networks, with RWAs playing a major role in this shift.\n\n\"Our mission is really to build that bridge between kind of the large, planetary scale businesses that people use and are familiar with every day, particularly people who are not in the crypto space, and create that on ramp for those folks,\" said Richard Widmann, global head of Web3 strategy at Google Cloud, at Consensus Hong Kong.\n\nStartups can apply for one of three tracks: infrastructure, tokenization or decentralized finance (DeFi). Successful applicants will gain access to Google Cloud’s resources, including cloud credits, technical support and workshops led by Google engineers. MANTRA’s own team will offer guidance on everything from smart contracts and tokenomics to legal compliance and market strategies, the press release said.\n\n\"This is a powerful opportunity for startups to harness cutting-edge technology and gain access to resources and mentorship,” said John Patrick Mullin, CEO of MANTRA, in a statement. “With support from Google Cloud, this RWAccelerator will allow startups to reach new heights and significantly contribute to the wider Web3 community.\"\n\nApplications for the first RWAccelerator cohort are open through March 20, 2025, with the program kicking off in Dubai in April. A second intake is scheduled to open the same day the first round closes.\n\nThe launch of the accelerator follows MANTRA’s recent approval for a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), positioning it to offer exchange, broker-dealer and investment services in the region.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
