It consists of creating digital versions of assets like bonds, funds and real estate, that represent ownerships on blockchain rails.\nThe process offers operational efficiencies, cheaper and faster settlements and broader investor access.\n\nFor the real estate sector, tokenization's appeal lies in its ability to automate and simplify complex financial agreements, the report explained, such as launching a real estate fund on-chain with coded rules handling ownership transfers and capital flows. An example for this is Kin Capital's $100 million real estate debt fund tokenization platform Chintai with trust-deed-based lending, Deloitte noted.\n\nThe report outlines a three-pronged evolution of tokenized property: private real estate funds, securitized loan ownership, and under-construction or undeveloped land projects. Of these, tokenized debt securities are expected to dominate, hitting $2.39 trillion in value by 2035, based on the report's forecast. Private funds could contribute around $1 trillion, while land development assets may account for some $500 billion.\n\nDespite the advantages, challenges remain, the report noted, especially around regulation, asset custody, cybersecurity and default scenarios.\n\nRead more: Tokenized Funds' Rapid Growth Comes With Red Flags: Moody's",
