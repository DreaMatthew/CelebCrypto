    "content": "Four digital assets companies have just secured Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) licenses in the Netherlands, letting them operate across the entire 27-nation European Union.\n\nCrypto platform MoonPay, digital asset management company BitStaete, bitcoin lightning FinTech ZBD and prime brokerage and clearing company Hidden Road attained the much desired crypto asset service providers license from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), a filing from Dec. 30 showed.\n\nMiCA is a bespoke rulebook for crypto companies that requires firms to receive a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license from one member state which then enables them to operate across the entire European Union.\n\nThe European Union set a Dec. 30 deadline for its member states to implement MiCA, though not all countries have managed to.\n\n“MiCA represents a pivotal moment for the European digital asset industry, and we’re proud to have worked collaboratively with the Dutch AFM to be among the first to embrace this new regulatory framework,” said Ivan Soto-Wright, CEO and co-founder of MoonPay, in a statement.\n\nFan engagement platform Socios.com secured authorization from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), it said in a statement on Monday. The approval is for a class 3 Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFAA) license that will enable it to operate as a regulated Virtual Financial Asset service provider.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K., which is closely following after the EU in its approach to crypto, added crypto trading firm GSR Markets to its crypto register at the end of 2024.",
