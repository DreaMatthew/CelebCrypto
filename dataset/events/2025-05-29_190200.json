    "content": "The Bank of Russia said that financial institutions may offer crypto-linked instruments to qualified investors as the nation continues to explore crypto offerings.\n\n\"Financial institutions may offer qualified investors financial derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets whose yields are linked to cryptocurrency prices,\" the Bank of Russia said in a post on Wednesday.\n\nRussia has softened its stance to crypto of late as the asset has continued to see new highs. Though the central bank has warned institutions and their clients against investing directly in crypto, it has proposed allowing a limited group of qualified investors to trade crypto in an experimental regime that would last three years — something it says the government is still considering.\n\nThe country's finance ministry is set to unveil a crypto exchange for highly qualified investors according to reports, but no deadline has been indicated yet as discussions are still ongoing.\n\nHowever, in the Wednesday post, the central bank also encouraged credit institutions to be careful when considering the risks of these instruments, ensuring they are fully covered with capital and individual limits are set on them.\n\n\"During the year, the Bank of Russia plans to formalise the conservative approach to the regulation of credit institutions’ risks associated with fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices,\" the post said.",
