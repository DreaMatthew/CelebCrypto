    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\ncould soon hit record price highs, triggering accelerated gains in the wider altcoin market, as easing U.S.-China trade tensions may see markets react positively to a potential slowdown in the April CPI due this week.\n\nThe United States reached a trade agreement with China after two days of high-level negotiations in Geneva, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced on Sunday.\n\nBoth the countries announced a temporary reduction in tariffs with U.S. cutting tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% for a 90-day period. In a reciprocal move, China will also lower tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10% over the same duration. The surprise announcement triggered a surge in the bitcoin price, sending it past $105,000.\n\nThe trade deal comes after weeks of a tit-for-tat trade war that saw both countries raise import tariffs above 100%, threatening to inject inflation into the global economy. As such, the positive March U.S. consumer price inflation data released last month was largely dismissed by investors and analysts as a lagging metric that didn’t accurately reflect the escalating trade tensions.\n\nThe bears, however, cannot make that argument anymore, thanks to the trade deal.\n\nSo, a continued softening of CPI could raise Fed rate cut bets, providing a bullish catalyst for a BTC rally to record highs above $110,000. On the other hand, a hotter-than-expected CPI could be dismissed as backwards-looking, reflecting the April tariffs and not accounting for the de-escalation in trade tensions.\n\nThe CPI due Tuesday is expected to show the cost of living eased to 2.3% year-on-year in April from March's 2.4%, according to RBC. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to have stayed at 2.8% year-over-year in April, with continued moderation in rent inflation.\n\nAccording to 10x Research, consensus is that the headline CPI likely held unchanged at 2.4% in April.\n\n\"If this expectation holds, the market may view the inflation report as positive. Barring any negative tariffs headline, this week's week's inflation data could provide a bullish catalyst,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk.\n\n\"CPI could be bullish, and may bring new all-time highs,\" Thielen added.\n\nBitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, changed hands at around $105,500, just 3.6% short of hitting new highs above $109,350, CoinDesk data show.\n\nBTC has had a near V-shaped recovery from $75,000 since early April, with prices surging 10% last week due to continued inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nBlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has registered net inflows for 20 straight trading days, amassing over $5 billion in investor money, according to SoSoValue data. Last week, the Federal Reserve kept the benchmark borrowing cost unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, while reiterating the data-dependent stance on potential rate cuts.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell, however, offered dovish hints, saying \"the underlying inflation picture is good,\" while calling the inflationary impact of tariffs short-lived.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose 39% to $2,500 last week, the best performance since December 2020, according to TradingView. Other major altcoins such as XRP, DOGE, ADA and SOL surged 9.7%, 56%, 19% and 20%, respectively.\n\nAccording to HTX Research, there are no signs of speculative frenzy yet, meaning the rally could continue.\n\n\"Implied volatility (IV) in bitcoin options remains stable in the 50%–55% range, far below the extreme levels of 80%+ typically seen at the peak of past bull markets. CME Bitcoin futures open interest currently stands at $14.8 billion, well below the $20 billion peak observed during the 2020 Trump election period, indicating that leverage is still manageable,\" HTX Research said.\n\n\"As long as yields do not climb back above 4.8% and ETF inflows remain steady, Bitcoin is likely to consolidate in the $105,000–$115,000 range while awaiting the next breakout trigger,\" HTX added.\n\nUPDATE (May 12, 07:30 UTC): Adds details on U.S-China trade deals, updates prices.",
