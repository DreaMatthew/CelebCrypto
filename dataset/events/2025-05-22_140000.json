    "author": "Oliver Knight",
    "summary": "The token had a market cap of just $40 million before the purchase.",
    "content": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto project backed by U.S. President Donald Trump's family, announced Wednesday that it bought\nB\n$0.1821\n, sparking a 1,340% move in the BNB Chain token.\n\nThe purchase came after BUILDon announced it would be using WLFI's USD1 stablecoin to create real-world use cases.\n\n\"We just bought some $B to support the BUILDon team,\" World Liberty Financial wrote in a social media post. \"Love seeing projects choose $USD1 as their base pair — faster settlement, deeper liquidity, and growing every day. We hope to see more tokens make the switch,\" the post added.\n\nData from Arkham shows that World Liberty Financial holds 636,000 B tokens valued at $172,000.\n\nPrior to the purchase, the B token was valued at around $40 million in terms of market cap, attracting less than $100 million in daily trade volume. That volume figure over the past 24 hours surpassed $1.2 billion following World Liberty Financial's announcement.\n\nThe majority of that volume has taken place on decentralized exchange Pancakeswap, which is BNB Chain's answer to Uniswap. It is not yet listed on any major exchanges.",
