    "summary": "The fund aims to simplify institutional access to XRP for cross-border payments, crypto investing in Asia.",
    "content": "HashKey Capital announced what it says is the first investment fund in Asia designed to track the performance of XRP, the digital asset used in Ripple’s global payment infrastructure.\n\nThe new fund, called the HashKey XRP Tracker Fund, will be open to professional investors and will allow exposure to XRP without the need to manage the asset directly. It will offer the ability to buy through cash and in-kind subscriptions, and offers monthly liquidity.\n\nRipple will be an early backer of the fund. The investment deepens its strategic ties with HashKey, which already has Hong Kong-listed spot ETFs for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).\n\nThe company will continue to partner with Ripple on additional financial products, Vivien Wong, a partner at HashKey Capital, said in a statement. One possibility includes tokenizing a money market fund on the XRP Ledger.\n\nRipple’s Asia-Pacific managing director Fiona Murray said the partnership with HashKey is part of a broader push to bring more regulated crypto products to institutions in the region.",
