    "summary": "The deal expands Securitize Fund Services' offerings and brings its assets under administration to over $38 billion across 715 funds, the company said.",
    "content": "Securitize, one of the largest tokenized asset issuers, said on Tuesday it has acquired MG Stover’s fund administration business, making its subsidiary Securitize Fund Services the largest digital asset fund administrator.\n\nMG Stover's team will now operate under Securitize Fund Services (SFS), enhancing the company’s institutional-grade offerings, the company said in a press release.\n\nWith the acquisition, SFS now oversees $38 billion of assets under administration across 715 funds, including Securitize's tokenized fund offerings such as BlackRock's $2.45 billion tokenized U.S. Treasury fund (BUIDL). Securitize now offers an integrated suite of services: fund administration, token issuance, brokerage, transfer agency, and an alternative trading system (ATS).\n\nThe deal signals growing consolidation in the digital asset infrastructure space, where companies are racing to build compliant platforms that mirror traditional finance but live on blockchain rails. For asset managers, this means they can issue tokenized securities, administer them, and trade them—without leaving the ecosystem.\n\nCarlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said that the acquisition \"cements our role as the most comprehensive platform for institutional grade real-world asset tokenization and fund administration.\"\n\nAsset tokenization is perhaps the fastest growing digital asset sector, as global traditional finance firms and banks increasingly use blockchains for moving and managing instruments like funds, bonds and credit. BCG and Ripple projected the tokenized asset market to reach $18 trillion by 2033. However, the rapid growth also comes with risks, including operational inexperience, according to a Moody's report.\n\nRead more: Tokenized Funds' Rapid Growth Comes With Red Flags: Moody's",
