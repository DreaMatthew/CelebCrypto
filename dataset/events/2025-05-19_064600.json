    "content": "Tokyo-listed investment firm Metaplanet has purchased another 1,004 bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,833.97\nfor approximately $104.3 million, bringing its total holdings to 7,800 BTC.\n\nThe average purchase price for this latest tranche was $103,873 per bitcoin, according to a Monday disclosure.\n\nThe company’s total bitcoin position, acquired at an average price of $91,300 per BTC, is now valued at just over $806 million based on current market prices. The move is part of Metaplanet’s long-term goal to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.\n\nIt began acquiring bitcoin in April 2024 and has since leaned heavily into a treasury strategy modeled after firms like Strategy (MSTR).\n\nThe latest purchase comes as bitcoin continues to hover just below its all-time high, trading around $103,343 at the time of writing. The broader crypto market has rallied in recent weeks amid improving macro sentiment.\n\nMetaplanet has financed its bitcoin acquisitions through a series of bond sales, most recently completing its 15th ordinary bond issuance, worth $15 million.",
