    "content": "HONG KONG – Investors in Europe can now get direct exposure to the CoinDesk 20, an index representing the largest crypto assets, thanks to a new exchange-traded product (ETP) from WisdomTree launched at Consensus Hong Kong.\n\n“The launch of the first CoinDesk 20 ETP with WisdomTree is a defining moment for digital asset investing in Europe,\" Alan Campbell, President of CoinDesk Indices, said in a release. \"The CoinDesk 20 provides institutional investors with a streamlined way to access the largest digital assets beyond Bitcoin.\"\n\nWisdomTree's Physical CoinDesk 20 ETP (WCRP) offers exposure to the digital assets listed on the CoinDesk 20, in a similar way to other ETPs that offer exposure to traditional finance's S&P 500 or the NASDAQ.\n\nWCRP is listed on Deutsche Börse Xetra, the Swiss Stock Exchange SIX, and Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.\n\nAdditionally, WCRP generates a staking yield, allowing investors to benefit from rewards earned by helping secure the underlying blockchain networks.\n\nThe CoinDesk 20 Index, launched in January 2024, has quickly become a key benchmark for digital asset investors, with over $14 billion in trading volume in its first year.",
