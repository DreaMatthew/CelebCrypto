    "summary": "Despite recent market turbulence, Shiba Inu shows signs of technical recovery while Shibarium reaches 1 billion transaction milestone",
    "content": "The cryptocurrency market experienced significant turbulence as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China sent shockwaves through global financial markets.\nSHIB\n$0.0₅9052\nwas not spared from the selloff, plummeting to $0.00001038 - its lowest level since February 2023 - as investors fled risk assets following President Trump's announcement of new tariff policies.\n\nThe meme coin's dramatic decline came despite positive developments within its ecosystem, including Shibarium's achievement of processing over 1 billion transactions. The layer-2 scaling solution has now processed more than 10.3 million blocks since its launch, averaging approximately 4.4 million daily transactions, making it one of the fastest-growing networks on Ethereum.\n\nSome technical analysts note that SHIB has formed a potential double-bottom pattern around the $0.00001050 support level. Recent price action shows signs of recovery as the asset reclaims the $0.00001097 level with increasing volume. However, with SHIB's open interest declining by $454 million since January and funding rates turning negative, short-term bearish sentiment remains strong despite the potential for continuation toward the $0.00001150 resistance zone if current support holds, according to CoinDesk Research technical analysis model.\n\nDisclaimer: This article was generated with AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
