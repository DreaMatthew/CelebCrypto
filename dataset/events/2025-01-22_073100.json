    "content": "Privacy-focused digital assets might make some noise soon as their leader,\nXMR\n$344.26\n, has broken out of a prolonged \"basing pattern,\" signaling a bullish shift in momentum.\n\nFor over two years, monero was locked in a basing pattern or low-volatility price consolidation between $100 to $200, marking a demand-supply equilibrium following the crash from the 2021 highs above $500.\n\nPrices now appear to have established a foothold above $200, which means the floating supply at bear market lows has been absorbed, and the path of least resistance is upwards, as followers of the Wyckoff analysis method would describe it. The next significant resistance level is at $287, the lower high reached in April 2022. A move back into the sideways channel would invalidate the bullish outlook.",
