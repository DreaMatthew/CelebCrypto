    "summary": "The bank’s decision will depend on regulatory developments in Brazil and the success of stablecoin rollouts by U.S. financial institutions.",
    "content": "Itaú Unibanco, Brazil’s largest bank by assets, is exploring whether to issue its own stablecoin as regulatory discussions evolve and U.S. financial institutions slowly move into the sector.\n\nThe decision could hinge on how American institutions fare with their stablecoin rollouts, said Guto Antunes, head of digital assets at Itaú. At an industry event in São Paulo, Antunes cited the growing momentum behind blockchain-based settlement systems.\n\n“Itaú has always had stablecoins on its radar. We cannot ignore the strength that blockchain has to settle transactions atomically,” local media quoted him saying. Stablecoins, for now, remain a “topic on the agenda.”\n\nThe renewed interest in stablecoins comes on the heels of a political shift in the U.S., where lawmakers rejected a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in favor of encouraging private stablecoin alternatives to preserve the dollar’s dominance.\n\nIn Brazil, regulators are conducting a public consultation—Consulta Pública No. 111—focused on how stablecoins might fit into the existing financial system. Antunes said the bank is waiting to see what rules the central bank sets before advancing any internal project.\n\nAntunes also raised concerns about a proposed ban on self-custody in Brazil’s draft stablecoin rules. Brazil, it’s worth noting, has barred major pension funds from investing in cryptocurrencies.",
