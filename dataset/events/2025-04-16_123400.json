    "summary": "DWF Labs opened a New York office and invested in World Liberty Financial, backing its stablecoin USD1 and decentralized finance growth",
    "content": "DWF Labs is investing $25 million in\nWLFI\n$0.1276\n, the decentralized finance protocol backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his family.\nThe crypto market maker is also entering the U.S. market with a new office in New York City as part of its broader expansion plans, according to a press release on Wednesday.\n\nBy establishing a physical presence in the U.S., DWF aims to work more closely with traditional financial institutions, expand its local workforce and engage more directly with U.S. regulators.\n\nThe firm also plans to deepen ties with American colleges and universities to promote education on cryptocurrencies. The WLFI token purchase gives DWF Labs a governance stake in the project, which includes USD1, the project’s soon-to-launch stablecoin backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bills, cash, and equivalents.\n\nDWF Labs said it will supply liquidity for the USD1 ecosystem, using its trading infrastructure to support activity on both centralized and decentralized platforms.\n\nZak Folkman, co-founder of WLFI, said DWF’s involvement is expected to accelerate “the next-generation infrastructure we’re actively building and deploying at WLFI.” DWF Labs Managing Partner Andrei Grachev, meanwhile, said that the firm’s physical presence in the U.S. reflects its confidence in “America’s role as the next growth region for institutional crypto adoption.”\n\nWLFI is positioning USD1 as a stable, institutional-grade stablecoin designed to meet rising demand from “sovereign investors and major institutions.”",
