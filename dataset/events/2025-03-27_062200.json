    "summary": "President Donald Trump warned he'll impose larger import tariffs on the European Union and Canada if they collaborate to harm the U.S. economy.",
    "content": "President Donald Trump has threatened bigger import tariffs against the European Union (EU) and Canada if they work together \"to do economic harm\" to the U.S.\n\n\"If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!” Trump said in a late Wednesday night post on Truth Social.\n\nFinancial markets remained steady in the wake of the new threat, with BTC in stasis below $88,000. Germany's DAX futures fell 0.3% while their Wall Street counterparts traded flat to positive.\n\nThe resilience in the market likely stems from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent indication that the inflationary pressures resulting from tariffs could be transitory.",
