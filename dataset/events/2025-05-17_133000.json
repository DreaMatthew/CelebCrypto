It was busy, to put it mildly.\n\nYou’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.\n\nIt's been a hectic week, watching the Senate's ongoing negotiations over its stablecoin bill, trying to track other legislation and the courts (more on that later perhaps) and just generally meeting folks here in Toronto.\n\nHere's a selection of CoinDesk's coverage from the past week.\n\nMonday\n\nWednesday\n\nIf you’ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you’d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Bluesky @nikhileshde.bsky.social.\n\nYou can also join the group conversation on Telegram.\n\nSee ya’ll next week!",
