    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe recent market turmoil might have given gold the bragging rights of being the \"store of value\" while \"digital gold\" struggles, at least for now.\n\nGold futures for April delivery have surpassed $3,000 an ounce for the first time ever, marking a historic milestone for the precious metal. Spot gold is consolidating just below $3,000 an ounce, up 15% year-to-date, while its digital counterpart, bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\n, is struggling—down 12% this year and hovering around $80,000.\n\nThis divergence underscores gold’s role as the ultimate safe-haven asset in the current economic environment.\n\nSince mid-February, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have experienced only three days of inflows, causing total net inflows to decline from $40 billion to approximately $35 billion, according to Eric Balchunas, a senior Bloomberg ETF analyst.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 has entered correction territory, falling over 10% and struggling to reclaim its 200-day moving average amid escalating geopolitical tensions. Further tariffs imposed by former President Trump and stalled ceasefire negotiations between President Putin and Ukraine have exacerbated global uncertainty.\n\nAndre Dragosch, Head of Research at Bitwise in Europe, attributes gold’s record highs and the U.S. equity sell-off to rising short- and medium-term inflation expectations, coupled with declining consumer confidence.\n\n“The recent rally in gold to new all-time highs likely reflects both increasing inflation expectations and a broader flight to safety,” Dragosch explains. “In fact, both short- and medium-term inflation expectations in the University of Michigan consumer survey have risen to multi-decade highs. U.S. consumers are growing increasingly concerned about inflation, likely due to the Trump administration’s new tariff policies.”\n\nHe further notes, “Meanwhile, U.S. equities have been selling off due to mounting economic uncertainty driven by these trade policies, as well as rising recession risks amid a slowdown in the labor market. Both factors have significantly buoyed the price of gold.”\n\nBy Oliver Knight\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
