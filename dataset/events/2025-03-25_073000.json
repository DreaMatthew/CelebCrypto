    "summary": "The Dogecoin Foundation agreed in February to a five-year partnership with House of Doge, which will be its official commercialization partner.",
    "content": "The Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge, has purchased over 10 million dogecoin (DOGE), worth just over $1.8 million, as part of a broader DOGE reserve strategy.\n\nHouse of Doge is the Foundation’s corporate and commercialization unit, which was formed in February with a five-year deal in place. It hopes to position DOGE as a payment currency, away from its predominant existence as a memecoin, as part of a framework to show it can be used for everyday payments at very low fees.\n\nHouse of Doge added it will unveil partnerships with various payment processors in the coming months.\n\n“With a strategic reserve, the House of Doge is laying the foundation for a payments ecosystem that ensures liquidity, stability, and reliability,” said Michael Galloro, a Member of the Board-Elect of the House of Doge, in a release. “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases.”\n\nDOGE was among the highest gains in the run-up to President Donald Trump’s election due to the possibility of its abbreviation becoming part of the administration: the “Department of Government Efficiency,” abbreviated as D.O.G.E.\n\nIt has since seen profit-taking and a sell-off alongside the broader market, with prices down more than 30% since January, according to CoinDesk market data.",
