Green energy projects often suffer from a mismatch in production and demand. A wind farm, for example, may generate a lot of electricity on a windy night — right when everyone is asleep and consumption is lowest. Instead of selling that surplus electricity at a loss, the affected company could potentially switch on bitcoin mining machines and turn a profit.\n\nThe West Texas project is Sangha’s pilot program. For now, Sangha itself owns the miner through a series of subsidiaries, and purchases electricity from the energy company, though the energy company may eventually integrate the operation.\n\nThe project is expected to generate $42 million in revenue in the first 12 months and mine roughly 900 bitcoin over the next 10 years. It will have access to electricity for anywhere between 2.8 cents and 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour on a 30-year lease, meaning that investors will be able to acquire bitcoin at a 25% to 50% discount.\n\nConstruction is projected to close in the second half of July, though unforeseen events may push that back a month, Marr said. Bitcoin mining should begin soon as construction is complete.\n\n“We expect to commission the project over the summer and use that time to iron out any initial kinks,” Marr said. “We purposely ordered 2% more ASICs than we needed to give us a margin of error for faulty machines.”\n\nWith $14 million raised so far through equity — partially thanks to Plural Energy, which enables mid-sized renewable energy projects to raise funds from investors on-chain — Sangha has secured 82% of its $17 million equity round target for the West Texas project.\n\n“By the fall, we expect to be a well-oiled machine and to be utilizing Plural Energy’s smart contract capabilities to stream distributions to our equity investors, who are excited by the idea of receiving distributions natively in bitcoin,” Marr said.",
