    "content": "Under far heavier pressure than the rather modest decline in bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nover the past few days would suggest, crypto stocks are posting outsized gains as markets surge higher on the Trump tariff pause.\n\nAmong the movers are Strategy (MSTR), which rose 25%, while Coinbase (COIN) climbed 21%. Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) were among the bitcoin miners posting gains in the teens.\n\nOther movers included Semler Scientific (SMLR) and Fold (FLD), with advances closer to 10%.\n\nThe strong uptick was in line with the big move in other U.S. stocks — the Nasdaq rocketing more than 10% higher and the S&P 500 8%.\n\nBitcoin climbed above $82,000, up more than 6% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe big gains come after a panicky few days in markets that nearly turned into a free fall on Monday and again overnight following President Trump's punitive tariff plan announced last Wednesday.\n\n“I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" said the president in a Truth Social posting midday today that set off the major rally.",
