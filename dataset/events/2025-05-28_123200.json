The proceeds of the raise will be used to repurchase debt from Telegram’s earlier bond issuance in 2021.\n\nThe messaging giant has 1 billion customers and reported a $540 million profit on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024.\n\nThe TON token, the native token of the TON Network that was developed by Telegram, is now up by 18.5% over the past 24 hours after starting to surge two hours before the announcement was made.\n\nThe move continued after the announcement, rising from $3.28 to $3.55.\n\nRead more: Telegram to Raise $1.5B Through Bond Sale Backed by BlackRock and Citadel: WSJ\n\nUPDATE (May 28, 12:38 UTC): Adds details of Telegrams $1.5 billion raise and additional context.",
