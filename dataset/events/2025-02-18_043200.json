    "content": "Donald Trump supporters are getting rewarded with a few dollars worth of his official TRUMP token if they had purchased any of the merchandise from websites associated with the U.S. president.\n\nThree TRUMP tokens, worth just over $50 at writing time, will be given to past buyers of Trump’s perfumes, sneakers, cards or watches per email address they used to conduct these purchases. The tokens can be claimed until Mar.1.\n\nTrump-affiliated websites sell products branded around his image or catchphrases and tend to fetch high prices in the market. In July, the limited edition Trump-themed Bitcoin Sneakers were sold for around $500 a pair, with some listed for resale for as high as $2,500.\n\nTRUMP is down 8% in the past 24 hours alongside a slide in the broader crypto market.\n\nTrump’s official tokens were unveiled just days before he took office on Jan.20, becoming the first sitting president to be associated with a memecoin. The token ran from a few dollars at issuance to over $75 at its peak - commanding a $13 billion valuation.\n\nBut sell-offs, a generally falling crypto market and concerns around the distribution of TRUMP have weighted down prices in the past weeks, with it down more than 75% from highs.",
