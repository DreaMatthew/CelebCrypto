    "content": "Paul Atkins’ first public event as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was a crypto roundtable on Friday, where the new agency chief devoted his inaugural speech to assuring the industry that he'll continue to remake securities policy to favor digital assets innovation.\n\nThe agency and industry have been awaiting congressional action to establish crypto market-structure oversight that will likely set guardrails, and Atkins told an audience at the SEC's Washington headquarters that the regulator will work toward delivering \"a rational, fit-for-purpose framework\" for crypto.\n\nHowever, in answer to a question from CoinDesk after his speech, Atkins indicated that the agency may be able to act to some degree during this wait for new laws.\n\n\"It's always good to have Congress' input, and if there's a statute to back up what we're doing, I think that's all the better,\" Atkins said. \"But we have ample room to maneuver under existing rules and laws.\"\n\nAtkins further suggested that he thinks the concept of special-purpose crypto broker dealers, a little-used registration most prominently represented by Prometheum, has been very successful and may need to be reconsidered, and he said the agency will look at whether custody rules need to be changed to \"accommodate crypto assets and blockchain technology.\"\n\nAtkins previously appeared at a swearing-in ceremony earlier this week in the White House, where Trump said \"he's the perfect man to lead this agency\" at a time when the digital assets sector needs regulatory clarity, and Atkins said a \"top priority of my chairmanship will be to provide a firm regulatory foundation for digital assets.\" But Friday's event at the SEC's headquarters represented his first full-fledged engagement with the public.\n\nRead More: Crypto Ally Paul Atkins Sworn In to Replace Gary Gensler Atop U.S. SEC\n\nThe crypto sector has high hopes for Atkins, though his stand-in for the past few months — Commissioner Mark Uyeda — already took a number of decisive actions to reverse the regulator's earlier crypto reluctance under former Chair Gary Gensler. As interim chairman, Uyeda reversed or sidelined a number of crypto policy efforts pursued under Gensler and has abandoned most of the regulator's prominent enforcement actions targeting the industry.\n\nUntil now, industry expectations for Atkins' leadership were based on conjecture rooted in his experience advising and investing in digital assets firms, especially since his Senate confirmation hearing failed to explore his crypto views.\n\nAtkins had served as an adviser to crypto entities such as the Digital Chamber and as a board member of tokenization firm Securitize, and his ties to Off the Chain Capital had previously linked him to its investment stakes in big crypto companies like Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Kraken.\n\nFriday's roundtable was the third in a series the agency has held on crypto matters, this time focused on custody in the industry. Crypto custody has been a particularly dicey topic at the agency, which under Gensler's reign had sought to approve a policy demanding investment advisers put their clients' digital assets only with certain qualified custodians. Gensler had argued that the rule was meant to exclude most of the existing crypto platforms as suitable custodians, but the effort was put on ice.\n\nRead More: U.S. SEC's Acting Chair Walking Back Agency Proposal on Crypto Trading Platforms\n\nAtkins was asked by reporters on the event's sidelines about President Trump's own crypto interests and whether Trump's memecoin, $TRUMP, will rob credibility from the White House on industry policy.\n\n\"I have no comment on any of that,\" Atkins said.",
