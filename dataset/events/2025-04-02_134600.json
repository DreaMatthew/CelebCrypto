    "summary": "Initial $50M draw supports early-stage development; full $300M project-level facility to fund buildout of 500MW HPC site in Pennsylvania.",
    "content": "Bitfarms (BITF) announced an initial agreement for a private debt facility of up to $300 million with Macquarie Equipment Capital, Inc., a division of Macquarie Group’s Commodities and Global Markets.\n\nThe funding will support Bitfarms’ initial development of its high-performance computing (HPC) data center at Panther Creek, Pennsylvania—expected to reach up to 500 MW of capacity.\n\nAn initial $50 million tranche has been drawn at the parent level to cover development soft costs and general corporate purposes. The remaining $250 million is contingent upon the achievement of key project milestones, at which point the facility becomes fully secured at the project level.\n\nEach tranche has a two-year term and carries 8% annual interest, with the initial tranche featuring interest paid in kind for the first three months.\n\nThe financing includes equity-linked warrants for Macquarie, tied to future draws and priced at a 25% premium to recent trading averages. Bitfarms will maintain minimum liquidity levels and comply with several customary covenants.\n\nCEO Ben Gagnon highlighted the strategic importance of the partnership, noting Panther Creek’s advantageous location near major metropolitan areas and its multiple power sources that support efficient, redundant, and scalable operations.\n\nBitfarms shares are up 1.44% to 81 cents in early U.S. market trading.",
