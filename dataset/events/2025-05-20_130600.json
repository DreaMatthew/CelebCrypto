    "content": "Energy management firm KULR (KULR) has expanded its bitcoin treasury to more than 800 tokens, with the purchase an additional $9 million worth of BTC.\n\nThe latest acquisition — made at an average price of $103,234 each — brings the total amount KULR has spent on the cryptocurrency to $78 million.\n\nThis continues the company's treasury strategy first announced in December last year, under which it committed to holding up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves in bitcoin.\n\nThe Houston-based firm, which develops energy storage systems for aerospace and defense, is measuring the success of this pivot using a BTC Yield metric.\n\nThat metric tracks the growth in the ratio of bitcoin holdings to the number of shares outstanding, rather than actual dollar returns or revenue. So far in 2025, KULR says that ratio has jumped by 220, according to this morning's press release.\n\nKULR’s shares are up 3.15% in pre-market trading at $1.3.",
