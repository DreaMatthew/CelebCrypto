    "summary": "The crypto donations can be accepted via a partnership with payments firm Radom.",
    "content": "Reform UK, the U.K. political party led by Nigel Farage, is set to become the first European political party to accept cryptocurrency donations, according to a blog post.\n\nThe donations will be facilitated by Radom, a U.K.-based crypto payments company that has VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) licenses for its crypto infrastructure.\n\nThe blog post by Radom claims that the average crypto donation is $6,000 -- over 30 times that of a typical fiat contribution.\n\nThe move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump received $18 million worth of crypto donations leading up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\nNigel Farage also announced that he would follow Trump's lead in making the U.K. a \"crypto hub\" if he becomes the next prime minister.\n\nFarage was famously cut off from banking services in 2023, creating a debate around freedom of banking and the restrictions imposed on those with different political views.\n\n“We’re excited to be working with Reform UK on this initiative. We appreciate Nigel Farage’s efforts in drawing attention to the issue of debanking in the UK, and we’re pleased to see a major political party embrace crypto,\" said Radom CEO Chris Wilson.\n\n\"We hope this encourages broader adoption in the UK and helps drive progress toward clearer regulatory frameworks -- something that we see as vital for sustainable industry growth.”",
