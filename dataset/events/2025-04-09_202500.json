    "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light for the trading of options tied to ether\nETH\n$3,332.80\nexchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nOn Wednesday, the regulator approved a filing from Nasdaq ISE, filed last July, which asked to list options contracts on the BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). Options are a popular trading vehicle to leverage and hedge risk and are especially attractive to institutional investors who are looking to control large amounts of shares.\n\nThe Commission had until today to make a decision. James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the approval was “100% expected.”\n\nThe options apply specifically to ETHA, meaning that BlackRock’s product is the only spot ether ETF that options can be traded on.\n\nOther funds are listed on the New York Stock Exchange’s Arca and Cboe. Cboe has also filed an application to list options on the ETFs it lists.",
