    "content": "President Trump's administration wants a weaker dollar and that's bullish for bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,914.57\n, asset manager Bitwise said in a report Tuesday.\n\n\"When it comes to the tariff push, the thing i'm most certain of is this: the Trump administration wants a significantly weaker dollar,\" wrote Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise.\n\nAfter a week of market turmoil cryptocurrencies surged on Wednesday following President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs for countries that haven't retaliated against the U.S..\n\nA weaker dollar has significant implications for bitcoin.\n\nBitwise notes that over the last five years the cryptocurrency has had a negative correlation to the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). When the dollar falls, bitcoin rises, and Bitwise said it expects this relationship to continue in the short term.\n\nThe longer-term implications of a weaker dollar are even more positive, the report said. \"A shake-up in the global macro system creates an opportunity for new reserve assets to emerge,\" Hougan wrote.\n\nA move away from the U.S. dollar as the single reserve currency to a more fractured system could give hard money, such as bitcoin and gold, a larger role to play on the global macro stage, the report added.\n\nBitwise said it was sticking to its year-end bitcoin price target of $200,000.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency was trading around $82,300 at publication time.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin's Resilience During Tariff Chaos Impresses Wall Street Firm Bernstein",
