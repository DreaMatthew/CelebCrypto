    "content": "Taproot Wizards has raised $30 million with which it plans to build an ecosystem of applications using the OP_CAT Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP).\n\nOP_CAT is a feature that Bitcoin's pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto included in the software's original code but which he/she/they removed out of concerns that it exposed it to risks such as denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\nMany developers have expressed a concern in bringing it back.\n\nThe proposal could bring Ethereum-like smart contract functionality to Bitcoin through introducing \"covenants,\" or rules that determine how a specific transaction will function.\n\nTaproot Wizards, whose vision is to \"make Bitcoin magical again,\" sold a collection of 3,000 non-fungible token (NFT)-like pieces of digital art called \"Quantum Cats\" to drum up support for OP_CAT one year ago.\n\nThe Wizards have been attempting to \"meme OP_CAT back into existence,\" according to an emailed announcement on Tuesday.\n\nCo-founder Udi Werthimer describes OP_CAT as \"the missing piece\" to attaining \"permissionless programmability for bitcoin, allowing lending, trading and smart contracts without giving up self custody,\" in Tuesday's announcement.\n\nThe $30 million funding round was led by Standard Crypto.",
