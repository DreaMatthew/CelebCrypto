    "content": "Crypto majors were little changed over the past 24 hours as markets settled from a rally, and then profit-taking from earlier in the week. Bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,998.62\ntraded above $93,000 in Asian morning hours Friday, with traders pointing to increased optimism of short-term gains.\n\n“With BTC holding firmly above $90K, sentiment is becoming increasingly optimistic,” QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast. “Call options at $95K strikes for end-April and end-May expiries have dominated flow, pointing to a tactical appetite for further upside.”\n\nCall options are contracts giving the buyer the right to purchase an asset at a set price before a deadline. A flurry of call option buying activity indicates traders are betting bitcoin's price will exceed $95,000 by late April or May — a tradeable signal for retail traders.\n\n“Still, with macro risks temporarily subdued and trade tensions cooling, BTC is likely to consolidate in a narrow $90K–$94.5K range while awaiting a decisive push toward the elusive $100K mark,” the firm said, reiterating its tone of remaining “cautious” as market sentiment hinges on macroeconomic factors.\n\nAmong majors, XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB stayed flat and Solana’s SOL showed a 2% bump.\nDOGE\n$0.1656\nand Cardano’s ADA zoomed more than 4%, while\nSHIB\n$0.0₅9094\nadded 5%.\n\nThe broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, rose 1.2%.\n\nOutside of majors, Sui Network’s SUI continued a multiday rally to bring weekly gains to over 62%. Catalysts include the ecosystem company xPortal, which is releasing a payment card that runs on the Mastercard network.\n\nhttps://x.com/SuiNetwork/status/1915395312111530191\n\nData from DefiLlama shows that the total value locked (TVL) on the Sui Network has exceeded $1.6 billion, an increase of over 9% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAdditionally, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Sui Network has seen its 24-hour trading volume reach $599 million, showing a 35% growth compared to the previous week.",
