    "content": "This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nImagine two major newspapers both endorsing the same presidential candidate. The joint support indicates that the candidate probably has a broad backing.\n\nSimilarly, when price charts for both bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,997.67\nand Strategy (MSTR) — the largest publicly-listed BTC holder — show concurrent bullish signals, it’s likely a strong sign that the market and major institutional players are aligned.\n\nDaily price charts for both BTC and MSTR show their 50-day simple moving averages (SMA) crossing above their 100-day SMA to confirm a so-called bullish crossover. It's a sign the short-term trend is now outperforming the longer-term trend, which could be a signal of the beginning of a major bull market.\n\nBTC's bull cross is consistent with other indicators like the MACD, suggesting the path of least resistance is on the higher side.\n\nThat said, an interim drop below $100,000 cannot be ruled out, as on-chain data show influential market participants have turned cautious.\n\nThe chart shows BTC's price rally has stalled in the $101,000-$107,000 range. A downside break could trigger more profit-taking, potentially deepening the bull market pullback to support at $98,000.",
