The shares rose 0.5% to $18.43 during early trading Friday.\n\nMining profitability improved in December as the average price of bitcoin gained 15%, outpacing the increase in the network hashrate, which was 6.5% higher, the report said.\n\nThe hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.\n\nAverage daily revenue was $59,585 per exahash, a 7.1% increase from November, Jefferies said.\n\nU.S.-listed mining companies mined 3,602 bitcoin in December versus 3,404 the month previous, the bank said. Jefferies noted that MARA mined the most bitcoin last month with 890 tokens, followed by CleanSpark (CLSK) with 668.\n\nMARA's installed hashrate remained the largest in the sector at 53.2 exahashes per second (EH/s). CleanSpark had the second-largest hashrate with 39.1 EH/s, the report added.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Mining Profitability Rose in December for Second Month in a Row: JPMorgan",
