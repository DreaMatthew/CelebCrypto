    "content": "The supply of stablecoins on Solana jumped by 112% in January to a record high of $11.1 billion, CCData (a subsidiary of CoinDesk) said in a research report on Friday.\n\nThe surge coincided with the launch of Donald Trump's memecoin $TRUMP, which caused a wave of inflows to the network, according to the report. Stablecoin supply has risen by 73.6% since $TRUMP launched on Jan. 18.\n\nTrading activity around $TRUMP resulted in record activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and contributed to stablecoin supply on Solana, surpassing its previous record set in 2022 and becoming the third largest network behind Ethereum and Tron, based on this metric.\n\nThe report also said that the market capitalization of all stablecoins has passed $200 billion, having grown by $37 billion since Trump won the U.S. election in November.\n\nThe increase in supply has also coincided with a decrease in the domination of Tether's USDT, the largest stablecoin with a market cap of around $140 billion. According to CCData, its share of the sector dipped from 67.5% to 64.9% in January, the lowest since May 2023.\n\nOne such beneficiary of this trend appears to be Ripple's USD, which became the fourth-largest stablecoin by trading volume on centralized exchanges in January, the report said.\n\nRipple spent much of the last few years locked in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The \"Trump effect\" has helped native token XRP jump by 33% to trade at over $3.10 this month, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse has spoken of a bump in U.S.-based deals and hiring as well.\n\nRead More: Grayscale Files SEC Proposal to Convert XRP Trust Into ETF",
