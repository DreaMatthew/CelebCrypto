    "content": "DogeOS, an application development layer for the Dogecoin ecosystem, announced the successful closing of a $6.9 million funding round led by Polychain Capital.\n\nThis capital infusion will fuel the expansion of DogeOS to allow developers to build a wide range of consumer apps — from gaming to artificial intelligence —while strengthening the\nDOGE\n$0.1650\necosystem.\n\nIn software terms, a layer is an operating system-like collection of software. DogeOS is specific to the Dogecoin blockchain.\n\nA bump in demand helps strengthen the fundamentals of memecoin DOGE, allowing the creation of applications and other decentralized finance (DeFi) services that bolster DOGE.\n\n“Dogecoin has always been about community and culture – DogeOS is bridging the gap between Dogecoin’s massive consumer community and real on-chain innovation” said Jordan Jefferson, CEO of MyDoge, the team behind DogeOS.\n\n“With over half a million users trusting MyDoge as their preferred wallet, we’ve seen firsthand the community’s demand for native Dogecoin experiences. DogeOS delivers on that demand – unlocking new use cases, more creativity, and a future where DOGE is built into everything,\" Jefferson added.",
