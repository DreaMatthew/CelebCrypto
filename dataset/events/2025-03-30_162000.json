    "summary": "Based on bitcoin's price performance since 2010, April could be the start of an uptrend, but risks remain.",
    "content": "It's a bloodbath for digital assets, with traders hitting the sell button, wiping out over $160 billion of the total cryptocurrency market cap since Friday.\n\nFew things have compounded as the first quarter of this year closes out, leading to the sell-off, including Trump's tariff threats, global economic concerns and the lack of a clear catalyst for the next leg up.\n\nHowever, if history is anything to go by, there might be some glimmer of hope heading into the second quarter, as April could bring a bullish setup for crypto.\n\nBased on the total percent return since 2010, April has brought in an average 27% return for bitcoin, marking it the third-best month, according to Barchart data. November and May were the other two months with the highest returns, with about 38% and 26% gains, respectively.\n\nAs CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole reported for Crypto Daybook Americas—a premium newsletter offering to help traders make informed investment decisions—this seasonality could be a much-needed positive indicator for the market.\n\n\"Seasonality factors are not as reliable as standalone indicators, but when coupled with other signs, such as the recent halt in selling by long-term holders, they appear credible,\" Godbole wrote.\n\nOne cog in the wheel may be the defunct exchange Mt. Gox's transfer of a significant amount of bitcoin to the centralized exchange's wallets, which could create fear of creditors' liquidations.\n\n\"A potential short-term risk is Mt. Gox, which has been transferring sizable amounts of BTC to Kraken—this may lead to temporary selling pressure or market volatility,\" said Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers.\n\nRead more: Now Is 'Really Good Time' to Buy Bitcoin, Says Trillion Dollar Investment Manager",
