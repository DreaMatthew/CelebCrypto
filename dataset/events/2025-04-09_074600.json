    "content": "Majors XRP, Solana\nSOL\n$157.52\n, and\nADA\n$0.5346\nare each seeing a roughly 6% price slump in the past 24 hours amid broader macroeconomic pressures.\n\nRecent market narratives show uncertainty around U.S. policies, including tariffs and a hawkish Federal Reserve stance with fewer expected rate cuts in 2025, providing the fundamental backdrop for a move further lower in crypto majors.\n\nHere’s what technical analysis and price-action indicate for these tokens in the near term.\n\nXRP, the token closely related to payments firm Ripple Labs, is below critical support levels with the next support threshold around the $1.60 mark. High leverage in XRP trading positions, as Coinglass data shows, hints at potential for more downward pressure before any recovery.\n\nSOL is down over 8% in a week and in a crucial support zone between $100 and $110. The current slump suggests it may be revisiting these levels or even lower, with thin liquidity below $100 potentially leading to a sharper fall toward as low as $50.\n\nADA has similarly declined by about 6% in the past 24 hours and down over 23% in the past two weeks.\n\nFor XRP, watch $1.62 as a pivotal support; a break below could see it target $1 or lower, while a bounce might signal a short-term relief rally. SOL’s fate hinges on holding $100—failure here could accelerate losses, but oversold conditions might spark a rebound if macro pressures ease. ADA bulls needs to defend its current range to avoid a slide toward 55 cents.",
