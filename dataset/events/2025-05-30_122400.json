    "content": "Dogecoin\nDOGE\n$0.1648\n, the popular meme cryptocurrency, endured a rough night as it plunged over 10% in a sudden sell-off that rattled markets.\n\nThe drop — from $0.226 to $0.202 — occurred around midnight, coinciding with a surge in trading volume to 1.18 billion, highlighting a scramble among traders reacting to broader market jitters.\n\nWhile DOGE managed a modest bounce from its lows, it remains stuck in a consolidation pattern between $0.202 and $0.206. This suggests the market is taking a breather after the initial shock, but traders remain cautious, with volatility tapering off and no decisive direction emerging.\n\nTechnical analysis shows DOGE testing multiple support levels during the crash before establishing a key resistance at $0.217. A potential double-bottom pattern may be forming, giving some hope to bulls eyeing a breakout toward $0.25 if DOGE can gather enough momentum to push past that resistance.\n\nOpen interest in DOGE derivatives climbed 2.89% to $2.71 billion, indicating traders are positioning for the next big move. Whether that move is up or down is still an open question, as mixed sentiment prevails across the market.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nAs the dust settles, traders and investors alike will be watching closely for signs of a sustained rebound — or a deeper decline — in the hours ahead.",
