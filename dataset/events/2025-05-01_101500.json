    "content": "Tokyo-based Metaplanet is establishing a wholly owned subsidiary in Florida named Metaplanet Treasury Corp., doubling down on its bitcoin\nBTC\n$102,012.78\n-focused treasury strategy that has made it the largest public BTC holder in Asia.\n\nThe new entity will be capitalized with up to $250 million and serve as Metaplanet’s dedicated U.S. vehicle for treasury operations. The company said the move would support round-the-clock operations across global time zones and expand its access to institutional capital in the U.S.\n\nFlorida was selected for its growing reputation as a hub for Bitcoin innovation and corporate adoption.\n\n“The state is rapidly emerging as a global hub where Bitcoin innovation, corporate adoption, and financial liberalization are accelerating,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, said in an X post translated from its original Japanese.\n\nThe development follows Metaplanet’s series of recent bitcoin purchases, with the latest a 145 BTC purchase last week that brought total holdings to 5,000 bitcoin.\n\nIts approach has increasingly drawn comparisons to Strategy (MSTR), the U.S.-based business intelligence-turned-bitcoin investment firm whose aggressive accumulation of BTC has become central to its corporate identity.",
