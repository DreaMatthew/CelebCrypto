    "summary": "The neobank offered the perpetrator 20% of the stolen funds to return the money within 48 hours, threatening legal action otherwise.",
    "content": "Infini, a prepaid payments card issuer that offers interest on deposited dollar stablecoins, warned a hacker it had “gathered critical IP and device information” after losing almost all the value locked in its wallets.\n\nThe attacker drained $49.5 million from the Hong Kong-based neobank's wallets, according to Peckshield. The company said only on Sunday it had hit $50 million in total value locked.\n\nThe exploit came just days after Bybit, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, saw a hacker drain its ether cold wallet and make off with nearly $1.5 billion in crypto's largest exploit.\n\n“We are closely monitoring the address involved and are prepared to take immediate action to freeze any stolen funds if necessary,\" Infini told the hacker in a blockchain transaction. \"In an effort to resolve this matter amicably, we are willing to offer you 20% of the stolen assets should you choose to return the funds.”\n\nInfini gave the perpetrator 48 hours to “facilitate a swift resolution,” and that failure to respond means it will “have no choice” but to continue its investigation in collaboration with law enforcement.\n\nAccording to Cyvers, the exploit occurred after a developer who helped set up its smart contract kept admin rights over it. More than three months later, they leveraged these rights and drained the funds to a wallet funded over cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash.\n\nThe neobank’s founder, Christian Li, has pledged to cover the full loss from his personal funds and took responsibility for the incident.",
