    "summary": "DTCC is the latest traditional finance firm to tap tokenization and blockchain tech for operational gains.",
    "content": "The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, is pushing deeper into crypto with introducing a blockchain-based platform for tokenized collateral management.\n\nCollateral is a fundamental part of risk management in financial markets, ensuring stability amid market fluctuations. However, traditional systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to fragmented infrastructure and lagging settlements.\n\nDTCC said its new platform seeks to address these challenges by tokenizing collateral on blockchain rails, allowing for real-time transfers and automation through smart contracts, according to a Wednesday press release. The platform runs within DTCC’s AppChain ecosystem, which was developed on top of LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain.\n\nRead more: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable\n\n\"Collateral mobility is the ‘killer app’ for institutional use of blockchain,\" Dan Doney, chief technology officer of DTCC Digital Assets, said in a statement. \"By using smart contracts to automate the full range of collateral operations, we enable complex trade execution across markets in real-time at any time, even in volatile conditions.\"\n\n\"This platform is unique in that we’ve created something that’s more open, flexible, dynamic, and comprehensive than any previous digital collateral initiative,\" said Nadine Chakar, global head of DTCC Digital Assets.\n\nThe initiative comes as tokenization of traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and other traditional investments has become one of the hottest use cases for blockchain technology. Multiple financial heavyweights like BlackRock, CME Group and Fidelity have thrown their hat in the ring pursuing benefits such as operational efficiencies, speedier settlements and increased transparency compared to using traditional financial plumbing.\n\nDTCC will showcase the platform’s capabilities at the \"The Great Collateral Experiment\" event on April 23, where industry participants will test how tokenized assets can be mobilized across markets. The company said it also plans to engage with regulators and industry leaders to establish global standards for tokenized collateral.",
