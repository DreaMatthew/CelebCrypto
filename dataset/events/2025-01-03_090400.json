    "content": "Programmable blockchain Cardano’s ADA token jumped 12% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among crypto majors, with rangebound trading in bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\ninfluencing the broader market.\n\nADA crossed $1, a three-week high, as BTC, ether\nETH\n$3,495.36\n, Solana’s SOL and\nDOGE\n$0.1623\nadded under 2%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, rose 1.57%.\n\nTraders expect bitcoin price-action to remain rangebound until late January, with gains expected from February onward as President-elect Donald Trump takes office, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.\n\nADA’s bump came on no immediate catalyst, but the protocol is set to see several fundamental developments in the coming months. These include a bitcoin-centric decentralized financial ecosystem and ongoing efforts to improve Cardano’s scalability, network performance and interoperability with other networks.\n\nPrice-chart analysis suggests further gains of as much as 30% for the token ahead.\n\n“ADA's three-day rise has lifted prices above a trendline characterizing the four-week pullback from early December highs,” CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole said. “The breakout and a renewed bullish crossover on the momentum indicator MACD suggest the potential for a re-test of the Dec. 3 high of $1.32.”\n\n“The widely-tracked 14-day RSI is looking to cut through a descending trendline, validating the bullish price action,” Godbole added.\n\nIn technical analysis, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicates momentum using average prices over a period, with a bullish crossover meaning a potential price increase. RSI (Relative Strength Index) measures the speed and change of price movements; and cutting through a trendline suggests continued upward movement.",
