XRP is a payments-focused cryptocurrency primarily designed for fast and low-cost cross-border payments.\n\nRipple, a financial technology company, uses XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to facilitate international money transfers.\n\nThe CME's standard and micro contracts, sized at 50,000 XRP and 2,500 XRP, respectively, are cash-settled and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference rate, which tracks the cryptocurrency's price daily at 4:00 p.m. London time.\n\nThese futures enable traders to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without actually owning it.\n\nCorrection (May 29, 2025, 14:06 UTC): Fixes typo.",
