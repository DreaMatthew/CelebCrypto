    "content": "Crypto exchange Kraken has begun offering commission-free trading for U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), opening access to traditional financial markets from within the same platform it uses for cryptocurrencies and positioning itself to compete more directly with platforms like Robinhood (HOOD).\n\nThe move expands Kraken's business as a growing list of U.S. crypto companies aiming to go public on U.S. exchanges — joining the likes of Coinbase (COIN), Marathon Digital (MARA), and Bitdeer (BTDR), among others.\n\nThe Kraken stock trading rollout begins in 10 U.S. jurisdictions including New Jersey, Connecticut and Alabama, with plans to expand access across the country and to international markets such as the U.K., Europe and Australia. Clients in these states can now buy and sell equities directly through their Kraken account using the mobile app, Kraken Pro or web interface.\n\n“Crypto isn’t just evolving, it’s becoming the backbone for trading across asset classes, such as equities, commodities and currencies,\" said Kraken’s co-CEO Arjun Sethi in a statement. \"As demand for 24/7 global access grows, clients want a seamless, all-in-one trading experience.”\n\n“Expanding into equities is a natural step for us, and paves the way for the tokenization of assets,” he continued.\n\nThis move makes Kraken one of the few crypto-native companies to offer traditional asset trading alongside digital assets under a single account.\n\nThe new product is offered through Kraken Securities, a FINRA-regulated entity focused on equities. By consolidating crypto and traditional finance tools, Kraken is positioning itself to compete more directly with platforms like Robinhood and Public that already cater to multi-asset investors.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
