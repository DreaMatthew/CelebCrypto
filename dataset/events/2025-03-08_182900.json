The initiative, called Licitação Seleção Prévia e Diálogo nº 25000001/2025 CS, is focused on finding advanced technological solutions to modernize business processes, operations, and internal supply management.\n\n“We want to promote a collaborative and dynamic process to find artificial intelligence and blockchain solutions for our business, operations, and hiring challenges,” the company announced.\n\nThe organization did not specify the exact use cases it is targeting, but blockchain technology has been widely adopted for supply chain tracking, document authentication, and transaction security. The use of artificial intelligence is likely linked to logistics optimization and enhanced data analysis.",
