    "content": "Ethereum developers on Wednesday initially celebrated a seemingly successful test of Pectra, the blockchain’s most significant upgrade since 2024, on the Sepolia test network. However, hours after the test, Sepolia began to encounter errors.\n\nIt was the second buggy test for the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, which is designed to improve Ethereum's efficiency, user experience, and validator system. The issues have led to calls from some developers that the upgrade be delayed.\n\nWednesday’s Sepolia test was expected to be the final step before Pectra’s launch on Ethereum’s mainnet. Initially, the test appeared to succeed, but later, developers noticed empty blocks being added to the chain.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation attributed the issue to \"an issue with Sepolia's permissioned deposit contract,\" which \"prevented many execution layer clients from including transactions in blocks.\" In other words, the problem stemmed from a misconfiguration specific to the Sepolia test, rather than a flaw with Pectra itself.\n\nEthereum Foundation developers said they \"identified the root cause within minutes\" and deployed a fix to restore the network’s normal function.\n\nDespite this, the test has raised concerns about whether Pectra has undergone sufficient testing. The previous test on Ethereum’s Holesky testnet also ran into configuration issues, that time caused by misconfigured validators.\n\n\"I do think the incidents on both the Holesky and Sepolia testnets warrant a delay to Pectra mainnet activation,\" Christine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital told CoinDesk. Kim noted that while developers may feel ready, the broader Ethereum ecosystem—including major smart contract applications and wallet providers—needs to be prepared.\n\nKim suggested that Ethereum’s developers \"spend the time to set up additional testing infrastructure\" before launching the upgrade.\n\nEthereum core developers are set to meet on March 7 to determine Pectra’s official launch date. Any delay could stir controversy among Ethereum supporters, who are already on edge due to a lagging ETH token price, leadership drama at the Ethereum Foundation, and mounting competition from networks like Solana.",
