    "content": "President Trump's executive order calling for the formation of a strategic bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,293.00\nreserve and a crypto stockpile is a \"pivotal moment\" for the industry, investment bank KBW said in a research report Friday.\n\nThe President directed his administration to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve to hold the assets that have been seized by the government. He also called for a stockpile of other types of digital assets.\n\nKBW noted that the \"world's largest superpower has embraced several leading blockchain protocols.\"\n\nBitcoin is the real winner here, as it is being exclusively treated as a reserve asset, the report said. No bitcoin will be sold and the government is also looking at options to buy more of the cryptocurrency.\n\nKBW estimates that the government holds about 198,000 bitcoin. It noted that roughly 55% of this stack will be returned to Bitfinex, leaving a balance of around 86,000 tokens.\n\nNo details were given about how the government plans to accumulate bitcoin, but it could sell some of its more than $800 billion in gold reserves to fund additional purchases of the crypto, KBW said.\n\nThe issuance of U.S. Treasury Bitbonds is another option, the bank said. These are treasury bonds that include a bitcoin \"kicker,\" and could lower the government's borrowing costs.\n\nThe government could also form partnerships with miners in the U.S. to receive bitcoin royalties in exchange for tax breaks or incentives, the report added.\n\nRead more: Market Experts Weigh In on Trump's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve That Takes Out $17B in Potential Selling From BTC",
