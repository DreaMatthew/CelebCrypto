    "content": "Crypto investment products brought in $785 million in inflows last week, pushing year-to-date totals to $7.5 billion and marking a full recovery from the nearly $7 billion withdrawn during February and March’s market correction.\n\nThe rebound was led by U.S.-based investors, who contributed $681 million, followed by $86.3 million from Germany and $24.2 million from Hong Kong. The latter saw its largest inflow since November 2024, according to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund flows report.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$101,833.97\nproducts attracted the lion’s share of last week’s inflows at $557 million. That’s a step down from the previous week and comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to signal a hawkish stance, possibly tempering investor enthusiasm.\n\nThe recovery is visible for U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs specifically. After recording $3.56 billion outflows in February and $767 million in March, nearly $3 billion came in last month. So far in May, these funds brought in $2.64 billion, according to SoSoValue data.\n\nShort bitcoin products saw their fourth consecutive week of inflows, suggesting some investors are hedging their bets or positioning for downside moves.\n\nWhen it comes to altcoins, ether\nETH\n$3,336.18\nproducts stood out. These brought in $205 million in inflow, the highest since March. That recovery was seemingly linked to the successful Pectra upgrade.\n\nOnly products invested in Solana\nSOL\n$157.61\nrecorded net outflows among the top investment vehicles, losing just under $1 million for the week.",
