    "content": "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the U.S. should prepare for war, not a bitcoin-driven future.\n\nSpeaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California on Friday, TheStreet reports, Dimon dismissed recent government moves to bolster a national digital asset reserve, arguing that real-world defense logistics, not blockchain assets, should take priority.\n\n“We shouldn’t be stockpiling bitcoins,” Dimon said. “We know what we need. It’s not a mystery.” He called for the prioritization of “guns, bullets, tanks, planes, drones, and rare earths.”\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump called for the establishment of a bitcoin reserve and digital assets stockpile. Dimon isn’t convinced about it.\n\n“If there’s a war in the South China Sea, we’ve got missiles for seven days,” he warned. “That’s not something we should be saying with a straight face.”\n\nDimon, a well-known crypto critic, revealed earlier this month that JPMorgan will soon allow clients to buy bitcoin.",
