    "content": "Where's the bottom for bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,998.62\n?\n\nWhile acknowledging it's possible that level has already been hit, on-chain analyst James Check suggested a true bottom may not be in place until after bitcoin suffers a true capitulation event.\n\nThat would likely require a decline to the $65,000 area, said Check, calling it the \"true market mean,\" i.e., the average cost basis for active investors.\n\nAt that point according to Check, who spoke on the TFTC podcast, the average investor may begin to feel the pressure of unrealized losses. Even long-term holders, including those who have held bitcoin for five years, could find themselves underwater. Interestingly, this price level aligns closely with Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has a similar cost basis of around $67,500.\n\nWhile Check expects sizable declines from the $65,000 area, he sees strong support in the $49,000-$50,000 range, those prices representing the launch of the ETFs in 2024 as well as a $1 trillion market cap for bitcoin. A drop to as low as $40,000 seems unlikely, he said, barring a global recession.\n\nCheck also took note of the extended period of \"chopsolidation\" in 2024 — where bitcoin traded for months in a wide range between $50K and $70K — as establishing a strong foundation of support.",
