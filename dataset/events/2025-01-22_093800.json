    "content": "Jupiter, a Solana-based decentralized exchange, will airdrop 700 million JUP tokens to its community on Wednesday in what it is calling the \"largest airdrop in history.\"\n\nThe airdrop is a part of the project's annual \"Jupuary\" event, which was voted into existence alongside another event in 2026 in a governance vote in December. It is scheduled to start at 15:30 UTC.\n\nInitial concerns were raised about the sustainability of supply increase, prompting the proposal to be amended to include a token audit and burn schedule over the next month.\n\nAt the time of writing JUP is trading at $0.87 after sliding by 2% over the past 24 hours. The total value of the airdrop is set to be $612 million.",
