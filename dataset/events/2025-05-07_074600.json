    "summary": "Market volatility may soar as a regional tussle between India and Pakistan intensifies and the U.S.-China trade war looms.",
    "content": "Bitcoin surged above $97,000 late Tuesday, then slid to $96,500 in Asian hours Wednesday as India conducted airstrikes in parts of Pakistan to intensify tensions from the past few weeks.\n\nA planned meeting to discuss U.S. and China tariffs sent risk assets higher in the hours since the U.S. stock market closed on Wednesday, as reported, but those gains reversed as news of India’s “Operation Sindoor” emerged in the early hours.\n\nTraders expect to see more volatility in the days ahead as the regional tussles further damage risk-taking sentiment among traders, though eventually leading to a move higher as bitcoin is perceived as a hedge.\n\n“Volatility in the markets is soaring as bitcoin surges to $97K from the intensifying conflict between India and Pakistan,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\n“This is in addition to plans by the US and China to discuss a trade deal this week. This upward movement came as a surprise, as investors were de-risking positions ahead of a decision by the Fed about changing interest rates. Geopolitical uncertainty and macroeconomic volatility may send Bitcoin to new highs as a hedge against greater market risks,” Ruck added.\n\nCardano’s ADA led gains among majors with a 3% bump in the past 24 hours, adding to gains from Tuesday.\nDOGE\n$0.1623\n, XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB and ether\nETH\n$3,495.36\nadded less than 2%, while legacy tokens\nBCH\n$495.32\nand\nLTC\n$86.10\nsurged as much as 10%.\n\nThe broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, added nearly 2%.\n\nMeanwhile, some traders said bitcoin’s surge in the past weeks was coupled with a spike in active addresses — a metric of wallet activity that some consider a sign of oncoming volatility.\n\n“Bitcoin’s recent rally to the $87,500–a spike in active addresses backs $97,500 range (now at a 6-month high) pointing to rising demand and renewed network activity,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\n“This surge supports a bullish case for a potential breakout toward $100K, though confirmation depends on multiple indicators aligning,” Lee said, mirroring separate analyst commentary from the past week.\n\n“Traders should also monitor macro conditions, Bitcoin dominance, currently nearing the 55% mark, and rising hash rates. Meanwhile, Ethereum trades in a narrower $1,600–$1,900 range, still lagging behind BTC’s momentum, with sentiment more muted amid fewer catalysts and cautious capital rotation into altcoins,” Lee added.",
