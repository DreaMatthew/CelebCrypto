    "content": "This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nBitcoin’s\nBTC\n$102,012.78\nweekend price movement has brought attention to the $88,800 support level, while XRP, the payments-focused cryptocurrency, seems close to confirming a bearish chart pattern known as the “death cross.\"\n\nBTC fell 1.5% on Sunday (UTC), diving out of a trendline connecting lows reached on April 9 and April 20, according to charts sourced from TradingView.\n\nThe breakdown of the rising trendline, a demand zone, indicates that the recovery rally from April 9 lows under $75,000 may have run its course, suggesting potential for a renewed price swoon. Prices crossing below the Ichimoku cloud on the hourly chart, a momentum indicator, also suggests the same.\n\nOn the downside, $88,800 could serve as a key support level, having previously capped upward moves on March 24 and April 2, which suggests it may act as a critical price point if tested again.\n\nThe bearish hourly chart set up risks invalidation on renewed above the Ichimoku cloud, which would reinstate the bullish outlook for rise to $100K.\n\nXRP's recovery from April 7 lows has run out of steam, too, with prices falling back below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA).\n\nMore importantly, the 50-day SMA appears on track to cross below the 200-day SMA in what is known as the death cross long-term bearish indicator.\n\nThe impending death cross, against the backdrop of the overall downward trend since mid-January, raises the risk of a deeper sell-off. Note, however, that the death cross' record in predicting price trends has been mixed in both bitcoin and traditional markets.",
