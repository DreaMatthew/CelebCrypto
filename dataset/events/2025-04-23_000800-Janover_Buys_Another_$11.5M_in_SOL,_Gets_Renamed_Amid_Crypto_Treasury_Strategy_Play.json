    "content": "Janover (JNVR), the real estate-focused fintech company with a Solana\nSOL\n$158.01\ntreasury strategy, has been renamed to DeFi Development Corp and purchased another $11.5 million worth of SOL tokens, the firm said on Tuesday.\n\nThe move brings the company's total SOL holdings to 251,842, including staking rewards, the company said. That's valued at around $36.5 million, with SOL currently trading around $145.\n\nJNVR shares were down 2.5% today at $38.3, well below last week's peak just shy of $80. However, the stock is still up over 800% since adopting the crypto treasury strategy. SOL advanced nearly 5% over the past 24 hours, with the broader crypto market climbing higher.\n\nThe purchase was part of the Boca Raton, Florida-based company's new crypto bet to position itself as the first U.S.-listed company with a treasury strategy centered on Solana and its native token SOL.\n\nAs part of the strategy, the firm seeks to accumulate SOL and operate one or more validators to secure the blockchain. The pivot happened after a team of former executives of crypto exchange Kraken bought a majority stake in the firm earlier this month.\n\nRead more: Janover Takes Page From Saylor Playbook, Doubling SOL Stack to $20M as Stock Soars 1700%\n\nThe purchase was made using funds from a $42 million financing round the company completed earlier this year. Based on the latest figures, each share of the company represents 0.17 SOL, up 62% from its last crypto purchase, according to the press release.\n\nThe firm will also change its ticker to DFSV on the Nasdaq exchange at a future date to reflect its new name.\n\nLast week, the company announced a strategic partnership with Kraken with plans to delegate part of the exchange's SOL holdings to stake to validators operated by DeFi Development Corp. The firm also teamed up with BitGo to acquire locked tokens via over-the-counter markets.",
