    "content": "Binance Square, the social network platform rolled out by crypto exchange Binance in October 2022, is launching a livestream product.\n\nThe feature, Binance said, will provide experienced traders and content creators another means of engaging their audience. Livestreams should foster learning, increase engagement on the platform, and enhance users' market insights.\n\nLivestreaming is already a feature on large social media platforms such as X.\n\nNotably, the Solana-based token production protocol pump.fun shut down its own livestreaming feature in November after some of its users performed pornographic or dangerous acts. It quietly revived the product in April with additional guardrails.",
