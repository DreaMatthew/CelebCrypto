    "content": "Two of the biggest corporate bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,481.19\nholders plan to continue adding more BTC to their already sizeable coffers.\n\nPer tweets over the weekend, Bitcoin development firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) plans to raise up to $2 billion through preferred stock offerings to fuel more bitcoin purchases in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nElsewhere in Japan, investment firm Metaplanet said it aimed to purchase 10,000 bitcoin (worth nearly a billion dollars at current prices), in the year, alongside several activities to ramp up general bitcoin usage.\n\n“In 2025, we aim to expand our Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC by utilizing the most accretive capital market tools available to us, CEO Simon Gerovich said in an X post.\n\n“Leverage our partnerships to advance Bitcoin adoption in Japan and globally. Explore innovative opportunities to grow Metaplanet’s impact in Japan and the Bitcoin ecosystem.”\n\nThe firm — colloquially called Japan’s MicroStrategy for being the only corporate bitcoin holder in Asia — sits on $175 million worth of BTC as of Monday and has a stock market capitalization of $830 million.\n\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy is sitting on $44 billion worth of bitcoin as of Monday and the $2 billion capital raise is said to be in furtherance of its previously announced “21/21 Plan,” a capital plan to raise $21 billion of equity and $21 billion of fixed-income instruments over the next three years, per a release.\n\nAs such, co-founder and board member Michael Saylor teased a Monday bitcoin purchase in an X post late Sunday with a picture of the SaylorTracker, a viral graph that tracks the firm’s buys.\n\nSince late 2024, Saylor has posted a chart of the SaylorTracker roughly a day before announcing fresh buys, leading to a bump in BTC prices in anticipation but a sell-off when official announcements are made.\n\nBTC trades above $99,700 in Asian morning hours Monday, nearing the six-figure mark amid a pick up in options markets.",
