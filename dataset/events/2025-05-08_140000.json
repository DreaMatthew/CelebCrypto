    "summary": "The company's \"Opening Bell\" platform lets SEC-registered shares trade on-chain, bridging crypto and public equity markets.",
    "content": "Superstate, the tokenized asset management firm behind the $650 million USTB token, is moving into stock tokenization with a new blockchain-based marketplace for public equities, first available on Solana\nSOL\n$165.41\n.\n\nThe platform, called Opening Bell and unveiled on Wednesday, allows companies to create tokenized versions of SEC-registered shares—not derivatives or synthetic assets—and trade directly on blockchain rails.\n\nUnlike current practices that rely on centralized stock exchanges and multi-day settlements, Opening Bell supports real-time, around-the-clock trading and programmable securities. The platform targets both already public firms on traditional stock exchanges and late-stage private companies seeking access to liquidity.\n\nCanadian investment firm SOL Strategies said it plans to be the first issuer on the platform, listing its stock for on-chain trading on Solana pending regulatory approval.\n\nTokenization has become one of the hottest trends in finance. Asset managers and even central banks are experimenting with putting real-world assets—bonds, funds, equities—onto blockchains to improve efficiency and broaden access.\n\nIt's a huge opportunity: tokenized assets are projected to become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, according to reports by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein.\n\nWhile the technology is advancing quickly, industry leaders including BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Robinhood’s Vlad Tenev have urged regulators to provide clearer guidelines. The SEC plans to hold a roundtable on tokenization next week, with Superstate general partner Alex Zozos expected to join the discussion.\n\nSuperstate registered its digital transfer agent with the SEC earlier this year, laying groundwork to align tokenized securities with the current regulatory framework.",
