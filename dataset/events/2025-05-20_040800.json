    "title": "XRP Futures Rack Up $1.5M Trading Volumes on CME Debut",
    "summary": "Early reporting data from CME showed a volume of 4 for standard contracts and 106 for micro contracts.",
    "time": "2025-05-20T04:08:00",

    "content": "XRP futures contracts began trading on CME Group’s derivatives platform on May 19, recording at least $1.5 million in trading volume during the first session, a modest but notable debut for the major token.\n\nCME data shows 4 standard contracts (each representing 50,000 XRP) traded on day one, totaling around $480,000 in notional volume at an average price of $2.40. The majority of activity came from 106 micro contracts (2,500 XRP each), accounting for over $1 million in additional volume.\n\nThe contracts are cash-settled and benchmarked to the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is published daily at 4:00 P.M. London time. CME’s dual contract structure is designed to attract both institutional players and smaller participants, offering flexibility for various hedging and trading strategies.\n\n\"The launch of regulated XRP Futures on @CMEGroup marks a key institutional milestone for XRP,\" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse posted on X on Monday. He added that Hidden Road executed the first block trade.\n\nThe listing follows the CFTC’s classification of XRP as a commodity, a regulatory green light that cleared the path for CME to offer these products.\n\nAnalysts say the debut could also strengthen the case for a spot XRP ETF, with ETF Store president Nate Geraci saying such a product is “only a matter of time.”\n\nWhile early volumes may appear modest, XRP’s inclusion on CME widens market dynamics for the major token in terms of price discovery, similar to how price-action on BTC and ETH futures is impacted when the U.S. market opens.",
