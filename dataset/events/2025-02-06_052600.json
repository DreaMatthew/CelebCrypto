The members have allocated around 1%-3% of their wealth into crypto, Sonnenfeld said, which amounts to around $6 billion.\n\n\"The areas of digital currencies remain really exciting. We have some members who are all in: it's become a gold substitute,\" Sonnenfeld said on CNBC. \"Gold is for traditionalists, bitcoin a bit new age, but they often play the same role. They are perceived as storehouses of value.\"\n\nBTC is up over 125% during the last year, according to CoinDesk Indices data, and is currently trading above $97,000.\n\nSonnenfeld also said that members' cash holdings have hit a 17-year low, which suggests high market confidence.",
