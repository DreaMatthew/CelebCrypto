    "content": "Kristin Smith, the longtime chief executive of the Blockchain Association, a leading lobbying group for crypto policy in Washington, is leaving next month to take a role as president of the new Solana Policy Institute, according to a Tuesday announcement.\n\n\"I am incredibly proud of what we’ve accomplished together and confident that the organization’s future is bright,\" Smith said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this week, Miller Whitehouse-Levine founded the organization and announced his position as CEO shortly after stepping down from the Defi Education Fund.\n\nThough the group hasn't yet clarified its source of funding, its website said it will focus its message on \"how decentralized networks like Solana are the future of the digital economy.\"\n\nSmith has led the Blockchain Association for almost seven years — a dramatic period for the developing industry. Since late last year, the political grounds have solidified under the sector's feet as it finds allies running all levels of the U.S. government, where crypto advocates have long been trying to get a comprehensive set of regulations.\n\nThe Blockchain Association has been a central player in the industry's lobbying.\n\nThe organization said its board is now conducting a search to replace Smith.\n\nWhitehouse-Levin once worked in that organization's policy operations.\n\n\"Innovators deserve to have the clarity they need to build a frictionless, Internet-based global economy — a future we believe is achievable with the right laws, rules and frameworks,\" he said in a statement during this week's launch of the Solana group.\n\nUPDATE (April 1, 2025, 19:09 UTC): Adds comment from Kristin Smith.",
