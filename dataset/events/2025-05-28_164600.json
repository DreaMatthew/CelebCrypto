    "content": "The crypto industry is on the precipice of mainstream adoption. But, like many exciting innovations from previous eras, this technology brings new risks. And these new risks must be mitigated before crypto can achieve its full potential.\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, steam power drove immense progress but carried deadly risks. Steam boilers exploded with alarming regularity — at one point nearly once every four days, wreaking havoc on lives and property. Early insurers stepped in to make this technology safer to scale. By providing financial guarantees against catastrophe, insurance turned what many saw as “acts of God” into manageable risks. Investors’ increased confidence allowed them to commit capital into steam-powered ventures, helping that breakthrough technology of the time further evolve to transform society.\n\nToday, Ethereum validators serve as new “steam engines” — critical infrastructure that can drive evolution, but are subject to inherent risks. In proof-of-stake, validators lock up and pledge their $ETH tokens to run and secure the network, but any misstep can trigger a slashing incident (forfeiting some staked funds). These events are rare, but their mere possibility has been a major concern for institutional participants.\n\nUntil recently, insurance for stakers only covered slashing incidents — a safety net like boiler explosion coverage, tackling the worst-case scenario to encourage wider participation. Now, insurance is helping the crypto industry evolve more fully; this month, crypto insurer IMA Financial and Chainproof launched a policy that not only covers slashing losses but also guarantees a minimum annual yield for Ethereum stakers. The return is pegged to CESR(R), the Composite Ether Staking Rate, the average staking yield network-wide. By insuring yields, this coverage brings a new level of security to their staking returns.\n\nInsuring validator yields opens the door to financial products once thought too risky. With a reliable floor on returns, we could soon see total-return staked ether ETFs and other structured products built on staking income. As staking moves into ETFs and institutional portfolios, insured yields will be imperative.\n\nJust as boiler insurance unlocked investment opportunities in railroads and factories, this new crypto insurance can unlock institutional capital for blockchain networks. By making cutting-edge ventures safer for investors, insurance supports the responsible deployment of capital at the edge of innovation — powering the next wave of growth with clarity and conviction.",
