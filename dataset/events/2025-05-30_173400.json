    "content": "Markets went red on Friday on renewed tariff-related apprehensions.\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$101,723.18\nis down 2.1% in the last 24 hours, trading just above $104,000 after briefly hitting a session low of $103,900. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — slumped even further, by 4.2%.\n\nSmart contract platforms were particularly affected, with solana\nSOL\n$157.65\n, sui\nSUI\n$2.0280\nand avalanche\nAVAX\n$16.53\nlosing 6.3%, 7.8% and 7.3% respectively.\n\nCrypto stocks also took a hit, especially bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer (BTDR), down 8.3% on the day after a run-up that saw the stock rise 132% from April 16 to May 21. Strategy (MSTR) slid 2.7%, and Coinbase (COIN) 1.3%.\n\nThe bleeding wasn’t contained to crypto. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 1% and 1.5% respectively, while gold lost 0.7%.\n\nBehind the price action was the flare-up of U.S. trade tensions once again after an agreement was struck earlier this month. The concerns came after President Donald Trump accused China in a post on Truth Social of \"violating\" the tariff truce between the countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview that talks had \"stalled\" with the Chinese representatives.\n\nChina, in response, urged the U.S. to \"immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions,\" BBC reported.\n\nThe cool-off between U.S. and China helped risk assets rally in May, providing a tailwind for BTC to clinch a new record high. The re-escalation now threatens to unwind some of those gains.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Whales Seem to Be Calling a Top as BTC Price Consolidates",
