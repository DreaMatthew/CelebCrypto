    "content": "The cryptocurrency market continues to navigate choppy waters as global economic tensions weigh on investor sentiment.\n\nShiba Inu has established a resistance zone around $0.00001467-$0.00001470, where high-volume selling has prevented upward movement, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.\n\nThe formation of lower highs since recent peaks indicates increasing bearish pressure, though the token has found support between $0.00001426-$0.00001436.\n\nRecent data shows Shiba Inu experienced a dramatic 74% decline in large transaction volumes, falling from 5.76 trillion SHIB to just 1.47 trillion in five days. This significant drop in whale activity has created a liquidity contraction in the ecosystem, with both inflows and outflows declining by over 80% in the past month.\n\nDespite these challenges, several analysts maintain bullish outlooks on SHIB's future.\n\nSome point to the token's expanding ecosystem, including Shibarium development, as reasons for long-term optimism. Changelly analysts predict SHIB could reach $0.0001 by 2029, while more ambitious forecasts suggest a potential $0.01 price point by 2040, though this would require significant supply reduction through token burns.\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights\n\nExternal References",
