    "content": "Telegram and X have not yet actually signed a deal that would bring xAI's Grok to Telegram, despite Telegram's Pavel Durov announcing it earlier Wednesday, putting sell pressure on TON's\nTON\n$1.8985\nrecent rally.\n\nThe deal would see Telegram receive 50% of the revenue from xAI subscriptions sold via its platform, along with $300 million in cash and equity as the messaging giant looks to raise $1.5 billion via a bond offering backed by BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel, CoinDesk previously reported.\n\n\"No deal has been signed,\" xAI CEO Elon Musk posted late Wednesday in response to the Telegram founder's announcement.\n\nTON, a token associated with Telegram, dropped from $3.60 to $3.28 in the moments after the tweet. The token had been on a rally in the hours after the announcement, previously up 14% on-day, according to CoinDesk market data.\n\nTelegram's Pavel Durov later posted on X that Musk's statement was true.\n\"Agreed in principle, but formalities are pending,\" he wrote.\n\nUPDATE (May 28, 23:17 UTC) Updates price information, statement from Durov.",
