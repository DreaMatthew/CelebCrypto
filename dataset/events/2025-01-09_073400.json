    "content": "Shifting regulatory tides in the U.S. and favorable price action could set up XRP for a 40% move higher in the near term.\n\nSince hitting highs near $2.9 in early December, payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP has lost steam to carve out what is known as a \"descending triangle\" pattern in technical analysis.\n\nIt is identified by a lower horizontal support line, representing consistent demand near a specific price level, and the declining upper trendline, representing shallower price bounces.\n\nAccording to the CMT Association's theory and analysis of technical analysis, descending triangles often end with a downside break. However, bullish breakouts are more reliable and profitable, producing an average gain of 47% to 16%.\n\n“In other words, XRP could surge 40% or more if prices top the declining upper trendline, signaling a resumption of the preceding bull run from early November lows near 50 cents,” CoinDesk markets analyst Omkar Godbole states.\n\n“All bets are off if prices diverge from the pattern, moving below the horizontal support line near $2.00,” Godbole adds.\n\nSocial metrics are on a high note, too. A Wednesday report from sentiment tracking service Santiment said there is an “increased level of optimism from the crowd,” toward the token, based on social media posts and market commentary — higher than that for bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,111.73\nor ether\nETH\n$3,479.09\n.\n\nSince Trump's election, XRP has seen its price surge by over 300%, outpacing other major cryptocurrencies. This surge is largely attributed to the expectation of a crypto-friendly policy environment under Trump, which includes easier regulatory pathways for local crypto businesses — such as Ripple Labs, the firm closely related to XRP.\n\nThe change in SEC leadership, particularly the exit of Gary Gensler, who has been seen as crypto-skeptical, could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP.\n\nRipple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse said last week that the incoming government ends years of regulatory limbo and opens up new domestic opportunities that previously \"froze\" under the old administration.\n\n2025 is here and the Trump bull market is real. For Ripple, this is even more personal after Gensler's SEC effectively froze our business opportunities here at home for years. The optimism is obvious and very deserved.\n\nToday:\n✅75% of Ripple’s open roles are now US-based, while…\n\nRipple Labs has reported signing more U.S. deals in the last six weeks of 2024 than in the previous six months, showcasing a direct \"Trump effect\" on local business opportunities.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Ripple President Monica Long signaled an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could “soon” become a reality amid the perception of a shift towards more favorable crypto regulations under the incoming Trump administration.",
