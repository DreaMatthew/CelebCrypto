    "time": "2025-01-31T13:45:00",
    "author": "Helene Braun",
    "summary": "The asset manager said the token has transitioned from a memecoin to a tool for global financial inclusion.",
    "content": "Grayscale has rolled out a new trust offering exposure to\nDOGE\n$0.1696\n, the asset manager announced Friday.\n\n“Dogecoin represents a paradigm shift in global financial accessibility,” Grayscale’s head of product & research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, told CoinDesk. “Its low transaction costs and rapid transfer speeds make it an optimal vehicle for international remittances, particularly in regions with underdeveloped banking infrastructure.”\n\nThe launch of the Dogecoin Trust, which charges investors a management fee of 2.5%, comes only weeks after President Trump — who (likely with an assist from Elon Musk) named one of his newly formed groups the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) — took office with the promise of promoting the crypto industry.\n\nSince the Trump election victory, several asset managers have filed applications for memecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including DOGE, an unthinkable move just months ago under the previous administration and its SEC head Gary Gensler.\n\nWith a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion, DOGE is the world’s largest memecoin. Wrapping the token in an ETF or in Grayscale's case, a trust, could attract capital from institutional investors. The token’s price has already increased three-fold over the past year, with a particularly large move happening in the immediate weeks after the November election.\n\nUPDATE (Jan. 31, 15:04 UTC): Adds management fee.",
