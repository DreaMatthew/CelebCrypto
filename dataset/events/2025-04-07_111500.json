    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nFear is gripping financial markets, triggered largely by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, with Hong Kong stocks plunging 14% on Monday, the most since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, and Taiwan and Japanese stocks sliding 10%.\n\nEuropean equities didn’t fare much better. The FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 are each down more than 5%.\n\nNor were crypto markets immune. Bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nfell 10% over 24 hours, dipping below $75,000, and ether\nETH\n$3,515.90\nplunged 22%. XRP and SOL also nosedived more than 20%, while DOGE is down more than 15%. Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, hitting 63%, a level not seen since early 2021. The CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the broader market, has lost almost 12% in the past day.\n\nAs for U.S. equities, the S&P 500 is set to start the week already in bear market territory — down 20% from its all-time high and 5% lower in pre-market trading — and on course for what could be the worst three-day performance in its history.\n\nChina, whose stocks fell 7%, is reportedly considering front-loading stimulus measures to soften the blow. On Friday, it announced a reciprocal 34% tariff on all U.S. goods.\n\n“We have massive financial deficits with China, the European Union, and many others,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend. \"The only way this problem can be cured is with tariffs, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the U.S. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold… We are going to reverse [the deficit], and reverse it quickly. Someday people will realize that tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!”\n\nSo, where can investors seek refuge? For now, it seems to be U.S. bonds. The 10-year note is up 8% year-to-date, while the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which tracks the long end of the yield curve, is up 6% as investors pile into government debt, pushing yields lower. This drop in yields is a welcome sign for the U.S. administration.\n\nSeasoned investor Bill Ackman noted that Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick doesn’t appear concerned about a potential economic crash, hinting that Lutnick and Cantor Fitzgerald, the financial services firm he used to head, are long bonds. Ackman suggested on X that they could be positioned to profit from a downturn.\n\nWhat’s next? Watch for countries scrambling to avoid the tariffs. Some, like Argentina, Taiwan and India, are already showing signs of conceding and removing tariffs on U.S. imports. The uncertainty surrounding these negotiations will likely keep markets volatile as the Volatility S&P 500 Index (VIX) hits 60 in pre-market trading. That's the highest level since August 2024. These are definitely times to stay alert!\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
