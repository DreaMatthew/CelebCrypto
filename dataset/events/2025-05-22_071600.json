It is worth over $1.1 billion as of Thursday.\n\nHanyecz has long shrugged off the missed fortune” tag, telling CBS in 2019 that the transaction made bitcoin “real” to him. He mined the coins back when BTC was under a penny, and few could have predicted the multi-trillion-dollar asset it would become.\n\nStill, the transaction remains a cultural milestone for the crypto market — a moment that showed internet money could work as actual currency. Now, it’s not just pizza being paid for with bitcoin. It’s property, cars, and in some countries, even taxes (briefly).",
