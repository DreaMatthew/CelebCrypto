    "content": "The native token of Livepeer\nLPT\n$5.1882\n, a decentralized artificial intelligence video processing protocol, soared on Friday to its strongest price in four months on exchange listing and other catalyst.\n\nThe token advanced 150% over the past 24 hours, hitting a session high at $14.20, CoinDesk data shows. The surge defied a slump in the broader crypto market, with bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nsliding 2% below $106,000 and the CoinDesk 20 Index declining 3.5% during the same period. Most artificial intelligence-linked tokens were down 5%-10%.\n\nThe price action happened as popular Korean exchange Upbit introduced trading with the token against KRW and Tether's USDT on its platform earlier on Friday.\n\nJoel Kruger, a crypto market strategist, highlighted that asset manager Grayscale introduced earlier this week its Artificial Intelligence Crypto Sector, with Livepeer being included among the 20 cryptocurrencies.\n\nEcosystem developer Livepeer Foundation's advisory boards also kicked into gear, starting a community survey about the platform's strategic direction, he pointed out.",
