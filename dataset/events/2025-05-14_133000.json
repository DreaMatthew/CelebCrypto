    "content": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is offering a new home for staffers departing the U.S. government's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nOn social media, Armstrong encouraged former DOGE operatives to apply for roles at the crypto exchange through a fast-track hiring process.\n\nThe move came after a Fox News clip featuring Ethan Shaotran, a 22-year-old former DOGE staffer and Harvard dropout, who said his work with DOGE cost him friendships and status on campus. Shaotran praised the team’s mission and work ethic, describing their late-night dedication to trimming bureaucratic waste.\n\nThis is an open call for any @DOGE staff.

The agency said it has saved $170 billion through asset sales, contract and lease cancelations, workforce reductions and more.\n\nCoinbase’s embrace of former DOGE staff comes after Armstrong publicly supported the idea of DOGE and called for the end of the income tax.\n\nCoinbase spent over $70 million in 2024 supporting crypto-friendly political action committees and recently added Trump campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita to its advisory board. The company’s shares have recently jumped over news they are being included in the S&P 500 index.",
