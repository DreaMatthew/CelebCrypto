    "content": "TORONTO — Despite a recent setback, U.S. President Donald Trump should be able to sign stablecoin and market structure legislation before Congress goes on break in August, said White House official Bo Hines on Wednesday.\n\nLawmakers are still discussing the legislation, which is good, said Hines, the executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said on stage at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.\n\n\"Negotiations are ongoing,\" he said. \"But I remain steadfast in my optimism that we're going to achieve — the President's desire is to do it — but stablecoin legislation and market structure legislation before the August recess.\"\n\nStill, he acknowledged that the legislative process was \"evolving.\"\n\nHines said earlier in the day that Trump's crypto ventures, as well as the president's family's tie-ups, did not pose any conflicts of interest.\n\n\"His sons have the right to engage in capital markets as private business people, like anyone else does in the U.S.,\" he said on CoinDesk TV. \"I don't see any conflict in doing so. By the way, it should be exciting that they're engaging in this space. If you're a good business person, you should be looking at digital assets and saying, 'how can I get involved?' Because this is the next generation of finance.\"\n\nHe repeated this argument on stage at Consensus.\n\n\"As we launch these tariff negotiations and trade negotiations play themselves out, we want to establish ourselves as a leader in digital asset financial technology more generally,\" he said.\n\nAsked on CDTV about reports that a small company was purchasing TRUMP coins, Hines said, \"I'll say very firmly, the president of the United States can't be bought.\"\n\nThe White House and members of its working group are still working on a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Hines said on stage.",
