A trend is taking hold in Japan, where companies—once cautious—are dipping into BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Several firms in the country have adopted BTC, with energy firm Remixpoint, NEXON, and Metaplanet among them. Metaplanet is the largest Japanese corporate holder with 4,525 BTC on its balance sheet.\n\nDisclaimer: The information gathered for this article was translated with the use of artificial intelligence.",
