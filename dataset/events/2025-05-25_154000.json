    "content": "Bitcoin's recent pullback has established strong volume-based resistance near $108,300, with support forming in the $106,700-$107,000 zone.\n\nThe correction accelerated with a notable price surge from $107,373 to $107,671 between 13:06-13:36, followed by a sharp reversal.\n\nTechnical analysis suggests Bitcoin is now trading within a compression zone, trapped between two major fair value gaps that will determine the upcoming market direction.\n\nIf bulls reclaim the $109K to $110K area, price could push toward resistance beyond $112K, while a break below $107,000 might test liquidity around $106K.\n\nTechnical Analysis Breakdown\n\nExternal References",
