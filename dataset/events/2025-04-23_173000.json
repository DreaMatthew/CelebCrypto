    "content": "TRUMP, marketed as Donald Trump's official crypto token, rallied on Wednesday as an invitation to a dinner event with the U.S. President for token holders appeared on the project's website.\n\n\"Join President Donald J. Trump at his Private, Members-Only Club in Washington, D.C. for Dinner!,\" a banner about the event on the project's website said.\n\nThe invite is targeted for the 220 largest token holders, per the event's website.\n\nThe token surged over 70% following the news briefly hitting $16, its strongest price since early March. Later it retraced to below $13, still up 43% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe event, notably, comes after $300 million worth of previously locked-up TRUMP tokens were added to circulation on April 18, according to Tokenomist data. Some 75% of all existing tokens are still locked up, with the next unlock coming up in July increasing the supply by over $600 million of coins.\n\nThe TRUMP token, launched only days before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration on January 20, was met with industry-wide backlash for capitalizing on the attention and Trump's public office and heavy allocations to insiders.\n\nThe launch also marked the peak in speculative froth on crypto markets. Bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,998.62\ndeclined over 30% from record prices in the following weeks, while many smaller, more speculative cryptocurrencies suffered 80%-90% drawdowns.\n\nDespite today's rally, TRUMP coin still trades more than 80% below its January 19 record price of $73.\n\nRead more: TRUMP Coin's Biggest Critics Are Crypto Industry Insiders",
