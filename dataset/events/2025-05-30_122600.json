    "content": "Bitcoin Cash\nBCH\n$487.61\ntumbled more than 4% in the past 24 hours, rattled by a midnight selloff that saw volume spike to 35,649 units and price action plunge below key resistance levels.\n\nThe decline — from $422.48 to a low of $403.83 — underscores the bearish sentiment gripping the crypto market amid broader economic uncertainties.\n\nTechnical analysis shows BCH struggling to find stable footing after the initial drop, with the $400.57 mark emerging as a critical support zone that has withstood multiple retests. Despite a brief recovery attempt, the $414-$415 range has turned into a formidable resistance level that has capped bullish momentum.\n\nIn the latest session, BCH experienced a short-term correction, slipping 0.84% from $405.25 to $401.86 before buyers stepped in to stem the bleeding. The bounce — accompanied by a notable 843-unit volume spike at 09:46 — pushed prices back above $404, hinting at some short-term optimism.\n\nHowever, the broader trend remains bearish, with BCH trading in a descending channel defined by progressively lower highs and lows. For bulls to regain control, BCH must decisively reclaim the $410 level and break through the $414-$415 zone that has repeatedly rejected recovery attempts.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nAs the dust settles, all eyes are on whether BCH can break the downtrend or whether the bearish momentum will drag it below key support levels.",
