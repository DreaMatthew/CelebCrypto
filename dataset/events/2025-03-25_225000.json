    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force will host four more roundtable discussions with the industry this spring, on topics ranging from tokenization to decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe Crypto Task Force’s first roundtable discussion — the kick-off to what Commissioner Hester Peirce, the task force’s leader, has dubbed the SEC’s “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity” — was held in Washington, D.C., last Friday. A dozen industry lawyers spoke about issues related to the security status of tokens.\n\nRead more: SEC ‘Earnest’ About Finding Workable Crypto Policy, Commissioners Say at Roundtable\n\n“The Crypto Task Force roundtables are an opportunity for us to hear a lively discussion among experts about what the regulatory issues are and what the Commission can do to solve them,” Peirce said in a Tuesday announcement.\n\nThe roundtable discussions are just one example of the SEC’s radical overhaul of its approach to crypto regulation. As the agency moves away from the so-called “regulation by enforcement” practiced by former Chair Gary Gensler, its new leadership — including Pierce and Acting Chair Mark Uyeda — have signaled a desire to improve their working relationship with the crypto industry and provide clearer regulatory guidelines to industry participants.\n\nThe next roundtable discussion in the series, “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading” is slated for April 11. The following discussions will cover topics including crypto custody (April 25), tokenization (May 12), and decentralized finance (June 6). Each of the roundtable discussions will take place in Washington, D.C., and will also be livestreamed.",
