    "summary": "The world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin is looking to raise around $500 million in an offering of Perpetual Preferred Strife Stock.",
    "content": "Strategy (MSTR) Tuesday morning unveiled its latest twist at raising funds from capital markets to fund additional bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,618.07\npurchases, but there are indications the Wall Street spigot is slowing.\n\nThe company's Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) offers a fixed 10% annual cash dividend, paid quarterly, according to an SEC filing If dividends are unpaid, they compound at an additional 1% per year (quarterly), up to a maximum of 18%. The first dividend payment is scheduled for June 30, 2025.\n\nStrategy's initial preferred series (STRK) initially offered only an 8% interest rate. And Strategy's series of convertible debt offerings came with negligible or even 0% interest rates (different product than preferred, of course).\n\nUnlike common stock, STRF holders do not have voting rights but have priority in liquidation with a $100 per share liquidation preference. Strategy has the right to redeem STRF if fewer than 25% of the original shares remain or if tax events occur, while holders can demand a buyback in case of a fundamental change.\n\nSTRF is expected to trade on Nasdaq within 30 days of issuance, offering investors bitcoin exposure with a high-yield structure. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Citigroup, and Moelis & Company are joint book-running managers for the offering, conducted under an SEC shelf registration.\n\nAfter buying bitcoin at a galloping pace over the past several months, Strategy's fundraising and token acquisitions have slowed to a crawl in recent weeks. The company last week did make additional bitcoin purchases, but they were hardly needle-moving — just 130 BTC for $10.7 million to bring total holdings to 499,226 tokens.\n\nMSTR is lower by 5% in early action Tuesday alongside a slide in markets in general and bitcoin's dip to $81,300 from $84,000 a day ago.",
