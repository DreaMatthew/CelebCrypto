Click here for tickets.\n\nThe funds were approved by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) on Monday, according to the note.\n\nMeanwhile, issuers in the U.S., including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck and Fidelity, are still waiting for the green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Solana fund.\n\nThere are currently two ETFs tracking SOL futures trading on U.S. markets, the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT), both of which have attracted a relatively small amount of assets, around $5 million for SOLZ and $10 million for SOLT.\n\nThe spot crypto ETFs, however, have seen immense success among investors, attracting multiple billions of dollars over the course of a year, with the bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,827.26\nETFs becoming the most successful ETF launch in history.",
