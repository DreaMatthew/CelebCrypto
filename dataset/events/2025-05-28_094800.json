Its ultimate aim is a full integration between Bitcoin and Cardano, providing DeFi services for BTC users and unlocking huge amounts of liquidity from the value stored in bitcoin.\n\nTo this end, IO has developed the \"Cardinal\" protocol, a portmanteau of Cardano and Ordinals, which harnesses BitVMX to assign Bitcoin-native assets to addresses on Cardano.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol was introduced at the start of 2023, enabling the inscription of data onto individual satoshis (the smallest BTC denomination, equivalent to one 100 millionth of a bitcoin), this making them unique and traceable. In effect, this created a Bitcoin equivalent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nRead More: Bitlayer Joins Forces With Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool to Supercharge Bitcoin DeFi",
