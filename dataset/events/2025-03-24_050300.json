    "content": "XRP is gaining momentum among bulls as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its long-standing lawsuit against Ripple Labs last week, marking a fundamental shift for the token.\n\nThe resolution has sparked optimism among XRP watchers, with analysts eyeing a potential climb to $10 by 2030, driven by regulatory clarity, the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and the possibility of a Ripple Labs IPO.\n\nBitget’s Ryan Lee noted a breakout from the current trading range of $2.35 to $2.55 could lead to extensive moves in either direction.\n\n“Short-term price targets range from $2.00-$2.17 on the downside to $2.65-$3.00 on the upside,” Lee said, adding, “Long-term forecasts suggest $4.20-$10+ by 2030 if Ripple capitalizes on payment adoption, though $2.50 remains a pivotal level to watch for the next breakout or breakdown.”\n\nHe attributed the medium-term range of $1.50-$5.89 to the SEC’s retreat and potential XRP ETF approvals, though technical indicators like a neutral RSI and bearish MACD suggest consolidation.\n\nThe RSI, or relative strength index, is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale of 0 to 100, signaling overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions.\n\nMACD, or moving average convergence divergence, is a trend-following indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a price, with its signal line crossovers indicating bullish or bearish momentum shifts.\n\nNick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, added relatively lesser volatility in XRP’s price-action was a further sign of sentiment leaning bullish: “XRP has fared well under the past months’ crypto selloff and has room to potentially continue upward, though momentum can be lost if U.S. macroeconomic factors and tariffs disrupt the industry.”\n\nThe forecasts come as IPO chatter is heating up, which Garlinghouse mentioned was “possible” in a Wednesday interview last week, providing further cues for bullish positioning.",
