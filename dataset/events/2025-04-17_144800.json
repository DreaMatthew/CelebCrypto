    "content": "VanEck is bringing an actively-managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking digital asset stocks to the market after receiving approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe VanEck Onchain Economy ETF (NODE) will aim to hold 30-60 stocks, VanEck’s head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel, said in a post on X.The management fee will be 0.69%.\n\nStocks included will range among crypto exchanges, miners, data center, energy infrastructure, semiconductors, hardware, TradFi rails, consumer/gaming, asset managers and “balance sheet HOLDers.” Up to 25% of NODE’s exposure will be in crypto exchange-traded-products (ETPs).\n\n“The global economy is shifting to a digital foundation,\" Sigel said. \"NODE offers active equity exposure to the real businesses building that future.\"\n\nThe fund is expected to start trading on May 14th and will use an offshore subsidiary in the Cayman Islands to be able to get indirect exposure to products like commodity futures, swaps, and pooled investment vehicles while complying with U.S. federal tax regulations.\n\nAs a growing amount of crypto-related stocks start trading on the market, with several companies looking to go public this year, investors are increasingly wanting exposure to crypto-related stocks. A survey among financial advisors at an ETF conference in March found that crypto equity ETFs are at the forefront of what advisors are interested in investing.",
