    "content": "World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance (DeFi) project linked to President Donald Trump, has made an additional $2.6 million purchase of TRX, on-chain data shows.\n\nThe project also purchased $9.8 million worth of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) on Thursday.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial now holds $355 million worth of crypto tokens including $181 million of ether\nETH\n$3,633.80\n, $56 million WBTC, $32 million of staked ether (STETH) and $10 million of TRX, Arkham shows.\n\nThe purchases come as sales of the project's own WLFI token heads into the final furlong with just 2.4 billion tokens of the total 25 billion still available. It has raised a total of $1.1 billion since the sale went live in September.\n\nThe increase in activity has been spurred by the pro-crypto sentiment stemming from the new U.S. administration, with a regulatory overhaul being planned following the exit of Gary Gensler as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief.\n\n\"I am looking forward to seeing the Trump administration's pro-crypto stance inspire and develop policies and initiatives that will drive innovation and promote financial inclusion, ensuring cryptocurrency becomes accessible to a wider audience,” Tron founder Justin Sun, who purchased $30 million worth of WLFI tokens in November, said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.\n\nUPDATE Jan. 23, 20:43 UTC: Changes headline and first paragraph to reflect that the purchase of TRX has been made.",
