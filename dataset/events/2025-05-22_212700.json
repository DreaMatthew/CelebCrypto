    "content": "Robinhood has added two Solana-based memecoins, Moo Deng\nMOODENG\n$0.08642\nand cat in a dog’s world\nMEW\n$0.001496\n, to its suite of cryptocurrencies available to trade for U.S. customers.\n\nMoo Deng, which is based on a baby pygmy hippo, has risen to a $230 million market cap this month after the meme went viral online in 2024. The token skyrocketed over 836% in May and jumped another 21% over the past 24 hours.\n\nCat in a dog’s world, on the other hand, is a token based on cats, which launched in March 2024 as part of a Solana meme coin frenzy. The token stands at a $368 million market cap after its price rose 52% in May. It is up nearly 20% over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe latest inclusions add to Robinhood’s list of meme coins, and the regulatory landscape is becoming much more flexible after the nomination of several pro-crypto government leaders and President Donald Trump's U.S. election win last year.\n\nIn November, Robinhood added the trading of Pepe coin\nPEPE\n$0.0₅5680\n, another popular meme coin. The trading app currently offers over 20 cryptocurrencies after previously ending support for several tokens in 2023 amid a crackdown on crypto by the former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Gary Gensler.",
