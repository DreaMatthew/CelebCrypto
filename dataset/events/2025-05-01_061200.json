    "content": "DOGE\n$0.1653\nprices were little-changed after reports of carmaker Tesla searching for a new CEO to replace technocrat Elon Musk, which the company later refuted.\n\nDOGE prices wobbled between the 16-17 cents mark in the past 24 hours, in line with a flat market. Musk is a known dogecoin backer whose comments, or developments at his companies, tend to impact the memecoin’s prices.\n\nTesla board members reached out about a month ago to several executive search firms to replace Musk, sparked by his heavy involvement with the Trump administration, per WSJ. The board members met Musk and asked him to acknowledge publicly that he would spend more time at Tesla.\n\n“This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published),” Tesla’s X account said early Thursday. “The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.”\n\nMusk called the report a \"deliberately false article\" in a follow-up post.\n\nTesla has accepted DOGE — the only token it supports — for merchandise payments on its site since early 2022. Users can directly connect their DOGE wallets to the site and transfer assets to Tesla’s Dogecoin wallets for purchases.",
