    "summary": "The rise comes amid reports that Bybit has allocated 100 million USDT to a new wallet to buy the cryptocurrency.",
    "content": "The price of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, ether\nETH\n$3,493.10\n, has risen by more than 2.3% in the last 24 hours, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index has risen by just 0.76% during the same period. Bitcoin is down around 0.3%.\n\nThe rise comes amid reports that Bybit, the cryptocurrency exchange that was hacked for $1.5 billion worth of ether and staked ether by North Korean hacking group Lazarus, has moved 100 million USDT into new addresses and moved half of that into addresses to purchase 36,900 ETH over-the-counter.\n\nThe funds, worth around $101 million, were then moved to addresses tagged as belonging to the cryptocurrency exchange, crypto journalist Colin Wu reported, citing, Arkham Intelligence data.\n\n\nBybit’s CEO Ben Zhou reportedly said in an “ask me anything” session that the company’s assets are “far greater than $1.5 billion,” adding that “there is a cold wallet in safe with nearly 3 billion US dollars in USDT,” according to the same source.\n\nBybit’s hacker is now holdings an estimated 489,000 ETH valued at approximately $1.34 billion, around 0.4% of ether’s total supply, which makes it the 14th-largest holder of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe addresses associated with the hacker are now closely monitored in the space and are blacklisted by major cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n“The stolen funds have already been marked, making it extremely difficult for the hacker to use them. Any attempt to transfer these funds to a major exchange would result in an immediate block,” StealthEX CEO Maria Carola told CoinDesk.\n\nSince the hacker may not be able to use the funds in any way, some analysts are suggesting that the 0.4% of the ETH supply it holds is “essentially gone.”",
