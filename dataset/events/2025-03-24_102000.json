    "content": "Crypto market maker and investor DWF Labs said it established a $250 million fund for investment in mid and large-cap cryptocurrency projects.\n\nInvestment sizes will range from $10 million to $50 million per project, providing capital and ecosystem support, DWF Labs said in a Monday email.\n\nThe firm emerged as a prolific crypto industry investor in 2023, with much of its investments involving buying several million dollars' worth of a project's native token. The approach, which differs from the traditional venture capital model of investing in return for equity, drew some criticism from commentators.\n\nDWF Labs' position as a market maker meant they kept their tokens on exchanges, indicating a risk they could sell them at any time. Managing partner Andrei Grachev told CoinDesk in May 2023 that the firm kept most of its funds and investments on centralized exchanges and that transferring tokens to an exchange does not indicate the company will sell.",
