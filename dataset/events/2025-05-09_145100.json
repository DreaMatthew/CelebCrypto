    "content": "Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, said it secured a MiFID II license from Malta allowing it to offer derivative products across the European Economic Area.\n\nThe license from Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) will enable the company to offer perpetual futures and other derivatives across the European Union's 27 nations plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, once the required conditions are met, Gemini said Friday.\n\n\"There are technical and operational steps to ensure we launch these products in a compliant and secure manner, which we hope to do so in the coming months,\" a Gemini spokesperson said.\n\nExchanges have been moving into derivatives as the next frontier for revenue growth. One of the largest crypto exchanges, Coinbase (COIN), on Thursday said it agreed to pay $2.9 billion to buy bitcoin\nBTC\n$102,205.43\nand ether\nETH\n$3,340.48\noptions platform Deribit. The purchase gives it an immediate \"dominant foothold\" in the derivatives space, a note from Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said at the time.\n\nIn Europe, Gemini is following in the footsteps of rival Kraken, which secured a MiFID license in February by buying a Cyprus-based investment firm.\n\n\"This is a hugely exciting development in our 2025 European expansion, as it puts Gemini one step closer to offering our derivative products to both retail and institutional users in the EU and the EEA,\" the company said.\n\nRead more: In $2.9B Deal, Coinbase Agrees to Buy Deribit to Expand in U.S. Options Market\n\nUPDATE (May 9, 15:26 UTC): Adds Gemini comment in third paragraph.",
