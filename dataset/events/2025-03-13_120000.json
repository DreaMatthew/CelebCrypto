    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$107,276.32\nstaking platform Solv has raised $10 million for its Bitcoin Reserve Offering (BRO) as it aims to build a $100 million BTC reserve.\n\nBRO merges aspects of traditional convertible bonds with crypto-native features to drive institutional adoption of BTC finance, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday.\n\nSolv is attempting to offer an \"on-chain MicroStrategy\" model, referencing the Michael Saylor-founded software company that now owns nearly 500,000 BTC.\n\nBRO may appeal to institutions who wish to invest in BTC as a store of value in a similar way to Strategy (as MicroStrategy is now called) but without physically purchasing and holding it themselves. Furthermore, they may be seeking a more active yield-generating form of BTC investment.\n\nSolv will deploy the BTC raised to various yield-generating vehicles, such as liquid staking tokens, and invested across decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world assets (RWAs) and institutional finance products.\n\n\"What this means is that Solv's protocol-owned Bitcoin Reserve will be active and productive, rather than having the BTC sitting idle,\" Solv said in Thursday's announcement.",
