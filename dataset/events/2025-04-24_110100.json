His leadership helped us obtain key licenses and establish the strong controls that underpin our operations today,\" a Portofino spokesperson said in emailed comments.\n\n\"We’re also pleased to welcome Dilan Bastin as our new head of compliance — her expertise will be invaluable as we continue to scale responsibly across global markets.\"\n\nArmstrong, who was based in London and had worked for the crypto trading firm for three years, declined to comment.\n\nPrior to joining Portofino he worked for legal firms including Dentons and Linklaters. He was also employed by the U.K.'s financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), for more than six years, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nIn addition to Armstrong and Blackborough, Cristian Dinu, a quantitative developer, also recently left the firm to join rival market maker Optiver, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe Swiss company told CoinDesk last month that it was exploring opening new offices in New York and Singapore.\n\nPortofino raised $50 million in equity funding in late 2022.
