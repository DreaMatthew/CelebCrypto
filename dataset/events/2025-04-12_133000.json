    "content": "Late Friday, attorneys with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Binance filed a joint status report asking a federal judge to continue a 60-day pause in the case for another 60 days.\n\nYou’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.\n\nWe heard about two more Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cases this week. The first, Binance and the SEC, was last paused in February, though late Friday attorneys asked for another extension to continue discussing matters. Separately, Nova Labs settled allegations with the regulator.\n\nAs we continue to watch the SEC develop its new views on digital asset issues, how it treats its active litigation remains a key signal.\n\nOn Friday, attorneys with the SEC and Binance (as well as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, Binance.US and other parties) filed a joint motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to extend a pause originally set to expire Monday by another 60 days.\n\nOriginally, the SEC said it was requesting the pause to see how the agency's new crypto task force might address digital assets and the application of securities laws. Friday's filing echoed this argument, saying the task force's work \"may impact\" its claims in the ongoing litigation. The original pause was set to end on April 14.\n\nThe SEC also filed a motion for a consent judgement after apparently coming to a settlement agreement with Nova Labs, the company behind Helium. According to the proposal, Nova Labs would pay $200,000 but would not admit to or deny the allegations.\n\nThe SEC first sued Nova Labs in January 2025 — specifically, Jan. 17, 2025, three days before Donald Trump was sworn into office as the 47th U.S. President.\n\nI imagine there are more cases or investigations being resolved than CoinDesk has caught — if you've received a Wells Notice and that's now been resolved, please hit us up, we're very curious. You can reply to this email or reach out on Telegram and Signal.\n\nWednesday\n\nThursday\n\nFriday\n\nIf you’ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you’d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Bluesky @nikhileshde.bsky.social.\n\nYou can also join the group conversation on Telegram.\n\nSee ya’ll next week!",
