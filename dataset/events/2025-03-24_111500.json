    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nRisk assets, including cryptocurrencies, perked up Monday on reports that President Donald Trump's expected reciprocal tariffs scheduled for April 2 may be more measured than initially thought.\n\nThe news came days after the Federal Reserve retained forecasts for two interest-rate cuts while downplaying fears of a prolonged inflationary impact from the tariffs.\n\n“Bitcoin is attempting to form a bottom, supported by Trump’s recent shift toward ‘flexibility’ on the upcoming April 2 reciprocal tariffs, softening his earlier rhetoric,” Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients.\n\nThielen noted the Fed's recent tone suggested that it will “look past short-term inflationary pressures, laying the groundwork for potential future easing.”\n\nAs BTC rose over 1% since midnight UTC to $87,300, AI coins, meme cryptocurrencies and layer-1 tokens posted bigger gains. Ether rose 4% to $2,090 with its supply held on centralized exchanges sliding to the lowest since November 2015.\n\nMantle Network's MNT token surged 6%, with Trump-linked WLFI snapping up coins worth millions. Other notable gainers included the TRUMP token, buoyed by the President calling it the \"greatest of them all,\" fartcoin and sonic, all up over 9%.\n\nTokenized real-world assets, as a category, rose into the $10 billion total value locked club, with Maker, BlackRock's BUIDL and Ethena's USDtb each accounting for more than $1 billion in TVL.\n\nIn other news, Andrei Grachev, the head of DWF Labs, announced a $250 million fund focused on established mid-sized and large-cap crypto projects. Bloomberg reported that Coinbase is in talks to acquire Deribit, the world's leading cryptocurrency options exchange. CoinDesk had the wind of it in February.\n\nDecentralized perpetuals trading platform dYdX announced a program to allocate 25% of the net protocol fees to monthly buybacks starting today.\n\nThe week ahead promises to be busy, with the U.S. personal consumption expenditure, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, due for release Friday. Additionally, SEC nominee Paul Atkins and Comptroller of the Currency nominee Jonathan Gould will testify before the Senate Banking Committee on March 27.
