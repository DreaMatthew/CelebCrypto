    "summary": "A fresh round of purchases of bitcoin would bring the company's holdings above 500,000 tokens.",
    "content": "On the sidelines from purchasing additional bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,293.00\nfor the past couple of weeks, Michael Saylor's Strategy (STRK) is at it again.\n\nThe company during early Monday U.S. hours announced a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering of its Series A preferred stock (STRK), proceeds of which would mostly be used for buying additional bitcoin.\n\nThe news gave a small boost to bitcoin, which — amid yet another panicky Sunday session — traded as low as $80,000 a few hours ago. It's currently changing hands at just above $83,000.\n\nStrategy by a mile is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, with just shy of 500,000 tokens worth about $42 billion at bitcoin's current price.\n\nIf MSTR were to fully utilize this plan over what is likely to be a sizable period of time, the total annual dividend payout would be approximately $1.68 billion. Dividend payments would likely need to be funded via additional common stock capital raises and/or cash generated from Strategy's operational business activities.\n\nMSTR shares are lower by 5.5% in premarket action and down about 50% from a record high hit in late November.",
