    "content": "Dogecoin's recent price movement shows a classic battle between bears and bulls, with the meme cryptocurrency finding stability after a significant downtrend.\n\nThe coin experienced a 9.7% drop from $0.237 to $0.214 before buyers stepped in at key support levels. This buying pressure has created what analysts describe as a \"panic zone retest\" around the $0.215 mark, which has so far held firm against selling pressure.\n\nMarket structure indicates DOGE is currently navigating a falling wedge pattern, typically considered a bullish reversal formation when broken to the upside.\n\nThe Ichimoku cloud on short-term charts shows price lodged in equilibrium territory, with multiple technical indicators converging to create tight reference levels between $0.212 and $0.225.\n\nFor traders, the immediate focus remains on whether DOGE can break above the descending trendline resistance near $0.219-$0.220. A decisive move above this level could target the $0.235-$0.244 range, while failure to hold current support might see prices retreat toward $0.20 or even $0.185 in the near term.\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights\n\nExternal References",
