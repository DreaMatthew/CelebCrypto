The desk continues to observe interest in BTC 28FEB25 80K puts and BTC 21FEB25 90K puts, reflecting persistent caution despite the skew still favoring calls,\" QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to say nonfarm payrolls grew by 170,000 in January.
