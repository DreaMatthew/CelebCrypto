    "summary": "Fundstrat's head of research, Tom Lee, calls for a potential short-term drawdown but remains bullish regarding the end-of-year target.",
    "content": "The consolidation between $90,000 and $100,000 for bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,884.12\n, continues to play with investor sentiment, swinging from fear to greed.\n\nOn Monday, bitcoin fell below $90,000, while it is above $96,500 on Tuesday, up over 8% . Bitcoin bull Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, told CNBC on Monday that he sees this current correction in bitcoin as normal.\n\n\"Bitcoin is down 15% from its highs for a volatile asset, which is a normal correction,\" he said.\n\nGlassnode data shows that bitcoin in this current cycle has seen relatively mild drawdowns of around 15%-20%, much smaller than previous bull market drawdowns, which saw as much as 30%-50% drawdowns, showing the asset is becoming more mature.\n\nAccording to Lee, $70,000 is a line in the sand, which is a strong support level. They refer to a methodology called Fibonacci levels, or retracement periods, essentially where bitcoin pulls back from where it started its rally. Lee also believes the $50,000 level can be tested if the prior $70,000 levels do not hold. Common Fibonacci levels from the all-time high that analysts look for are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%\n\nDespite a short-term correction, Lee still thinks bitcoin will be one of the standout assets for 2025 and remains bullish on end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000.",
