    "summary": "The move bumps utility and useability for the TRUMP token, which launched on Jan. 17 and has since entered the top-thirty tokens.",
    "content": "Several marketplaces hawking Donald Trump-branded merchandise, including GetTrumpWatches.com, GetTrumpFragrances.com, and GetTrumpSneakers.com, have started accepting the Trump memecoin as a payment method alongside credit cards and bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,885.63\n.\n\nPayments options now include TRUMP and will be processed by Solana Pay, a decentralized payment system that allows users to send money directly to merchants without intermediaries.\n\nThe watches will be made-to-order and start shipping from October onward, an FAQ on the website shows. As such, these official products are not sold by Trump directly but are part of a licensed agreement with CIC Digital LLC - one of the companies that helmed the issuance of TRUMP tokens.\n\nThe move bumps utility and usability for the TRUMP token, which launched on Jan. 17 and has since entered the top-thirty tokens with a market cap above $5.5 billion as of Thursday.\n\nThese initiatives mark yet another attempt to nudge crypto into mainstream commerce—a feat that has largely eluded most volatile tokens.",
