    "content": "Uniswap's native\nUNI\n$5.2053\ntoken has risen by 10% this week amid a wider altcoin market rally.\n\nThe move comes as bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nconsolidates around $108,000 after setting a record high of $111,970 last week.\n\nUNI is currently trading at $7.04 after rising to as high as $7.63 at 03:35 UTC. It is currently testing the $7.00 level as support, which had been a point of resistance over the past week.\n\nIf UNI holds above $7.00, it could establish a firm level of support before springing toward $10, which spurred a rejection in February.\n\nCoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index is currently at 25, the top-end of a bitcoin-centric market but rising significantly since last month, when it was at 12. The index signals an altcoin market when it passes through 75.",
