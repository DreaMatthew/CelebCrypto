    "content": "From May 29 to May 30, 2025, SHIB experienced marked volatility with prices varying between $0.000013252 and $0.000014508, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. A critical support level emerged around $0.000013285, where buying pressure was noticeable, triggering upward reversals.\n\nIn contrast, resistance near $0.000014500 indicated waning upward momentum. As SHIB's price stabilized around $0.000013390 towards May 30's end, a decline in trading volume suggested investor caution.\n\nMacroeconomic factors, such as heightened geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies, contributed to the increased volatility observed in the cryptocurrency market, including SHIB.\n\nFurthermore, the microeconomic backdrop featured an influx of over 2 trillion SHIB tokens into exchanges, which paired with a descending triangle pattern, indicated possible bearish movements.\n\nThese market dynamics pushed SHIB's price to remain fairly constrained, despite broader market gains.\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights\n\nExternal References",
