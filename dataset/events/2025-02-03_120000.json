    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nCrypto markets are a sea of red alongside a growing risk aversion in traditional markets, and Trump's tariffs are to blame. Late Friday, the president imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on China, provoking retaliatory measures that have reignited a trade war reminiscent of 2018.\n\nThe consensus on social media and among the analyst community is that this tariff-induced slide in the crypto market is temporary and that bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nwill quickly rebound. However, there are reasons to believe otherwise.\n\nFirstly, Trump has shattered the crypto market's belief that he is looking to pump markets and would use small tariffs merely as a negotiating tactic. In fact, he has threatened to increase tariffs if trading partners retaliate. Since Canada and Mexico responded with their own measures, the potential for further tariff hikes looms large.\n\nGeo Chen, a macro trader and author of the popular Substack-based newsletter, Fidenza Macro, shared his perspective in an email to subscribers: \"My view is that they will remain in place for several months with the risk of increasing, as Canada has pledged to retaliate and China has initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. in the World Trade Organization. These responses could escalate the situation. The best we can hope for is a partial rollback of tariffs once negotiations conclude.\"\n\nChen emphasized that the tariffs are driven by trade deficit concerns rather than the fentanyl crisis, as Trump likes to portray, adding that markets may take days or weeks to grasp this, leading to persistent volatility. Besides, the latest tariffs are on $1.3 trillion worth of goods that the U.S. imports from the three nations, which is seven times bigger in value than the first shot fired in 2018.\n\nAll this makes the latest episode appear more destabilizing than back then, when the S&P 500 initially dropped 9% from its peak in March before quickly rebounding. In other words, the potential pain may be greater this time around, which poses a challenge for risk-on assets like BTC.\n\nAs one crypto trader choosing to stay anonymous said: \"Despite the talk of deals, this move doesn't feel temporary.\" Stay alert!\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
