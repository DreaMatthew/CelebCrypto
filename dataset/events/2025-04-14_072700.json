The Japanese firm made its latest buy at an average price $83,147 per coin.\n\nThis latest purchase brings the company's total bitcoin holdings to 4,525 BTC, with an aggregate cost basis of $408.1 million and an average acquisition price of $90,194.\n\nThis move is part of Metaplanet’s broader bitcoin treasury operations strategy, launched in December 2024, aimed at using digital assets to enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe company evaluates its performance through BTC Yield, a measure of bitcoin holding growth relative to share outstanding. For Q1 2025, its BTC yield reached 95.6%, with a year-to-date figure of 6.5% as of April 14.\n\nThe acquisitions are supported by dynamic capital market activity, including bond issuances and stock acquisition rights, enabling Metaplanet to raise substantial funds while minimizing dilution. In total, approximately 41.7% of the company’s “210 million plan” has been executed.\n\nDisclaimer: This article, or parts of it, was generated with assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
