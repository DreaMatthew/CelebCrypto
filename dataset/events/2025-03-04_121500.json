    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe CME bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nfutures chart is in focus once again as bitcoin's recent 12% retracement has filled the latest CME gap—caused by the exchange’s weekend closure and bitcoin's price run up to $95,000.\n\nAccording to RiggsBTC, a post on X highlights a striking statistic: since bitcoin futures launched in December 2017, there have been 80 CME gaps, with only one unfilled at $21,000.\n\nZooming out to the macroeconomic picture, the U.S. economy faces slower growth due to fiscal cuts, trade uncertainties, and a weakening housing market. Inflation is expected to trend lower, with the Federal Reserve prioritizing employment over price control, according to Professor Satoshi, an analyst at Greeks Live Options Trader, told CoinDesk exclusively.\n\nProfessor Satoshi also views equities as overvalued, predicting a potential S&P 500 drop to 5700–5500. Meanwhile, the crypto market is experiencing de-risking, which often precedes downturns in equities.\n\n\"You can see altcoins got de-risked. This means majors get de-risked afterward. Typically, it's the crypto market down first, then equities follow\", according to Professor Satoshi.\n\nAdditionally, Professor Satoshi expects the Fed to likely skip a rate cut in March and the potential for a larger 50 bps cut in May. A potential return of quantitative easing in 2025, one he has been anticipating since last year’s growth scare.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve are always behind because they are data driven. On my bingo cards for 2025 is return of quantitative easing. Which no one thinks is possible but have been thinking this for sometime because ever since the growth scare last year, we managed to kick the can down the curb until now\".\n\nHowever, the strengthening Japanese Yen could be the canary in the coal mine, which is currently at its strongest level this year against the U.S. dollar at 148.
