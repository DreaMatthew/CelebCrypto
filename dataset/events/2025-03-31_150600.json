    "content": "OKX chief legal officer Mauricio Beugelmans has left the cryptocurrency exchange, according to his Linkedin profile.\n\nBeugelmans, who has been instrumental in shaping OKX’s global compliance policy, states on his profile that his tenure lasted three years and eight months at the exchange, from August 2021 to March 2025.\n\n\"I left OKX to pursue another opportunity within the crypto industry, which I will share publicly at the appropriate time. It was a privilege to scale and lead such a talented team of legal and compliance professionals for the past 3 1/2 years at OKX,\" Beugelmans said via email.\n\nJust last month, OKX paid over $500 million in penalties and forfeited fees in a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice which stated that the company had facilitated more than $5 billion in “suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds.”\n\nA source familiar with the matter said Beugelmans’ exit was related to the recent DOJ settlement.\n\nOKcoin, the American division of OKX, also received a subpoena issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Feb. 24 last year. The subpoena referred to “certain persons engaged in fraud and other unlawful conduct with respect to digital asset transactions.”\n\nOKX did not respond to requests for comment by press time.\n\nUPDATE (April, 1st, 14:40 UTC): Adds comment from Mauricio Beugelmans.",
