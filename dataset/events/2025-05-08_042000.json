    "summary": "Favorable tariff decisions can ease concerns around mounting costs, which may impede appetite for investing in risk assets.",
    "content": "Bitcoin zoomed close to $100,000 early Thursday as President Donald Trump said a tariff deal with a “big, highly respected country” is to be announced soon.\n\nTrump will hold a “major” trade deal news conference at 10 a.m. ET, where the announcement is supposed to be the “first of many.”\n\nThe identity of the country involved remains unclear. Still, some reports say it is believed to be the U.K. Easing tariffs could soften inflationary pressures and improve the backdrop for investing in crypto, tech, and other high-beta assets.\n\nBitcoin has gained more than 5% in the past 24 hours, extending its weeklong rally as macroeconomic conditions improve.\n\nA combination of falling bond yields, a weakening dollar, and renewed institutional flows into spot bitcoin ETFs has fueled upward momentum.\n\nThe announcement also comes amid rising political pressure on U.S. leaders to counter China’s growing influence and revive domestic manufacturing. While full details remain under wraps, any rollback of tariffs could quickly buoy prices of risk assets.",
