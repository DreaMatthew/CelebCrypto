    "content": "In today’s Crypto for Advisors, Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Bank, explores why crypto is more than just an asset class and looks at the institutional adoption of decentralized finance.\n\nThen, Abhishek Pingle, co-founder of Theo, answers questions about how risk-adverse investors can approach decentralized finance and what to look for in Ask an Expert.\n\n– Sarah Morton\n\nMoody's recently warned that public blockchains pose a risk to institutional investors. At the same time, U.S. bitcoin ETFs are drawing billions in inflows. We’re seeing the start of a long-awaited shift in institutional adoption. But crypto's real potential lies far beyond passive bitcoin exposure. It's not just an asset class — it's an asset universe, spanning yield-generating strategies, directional plays, and hedge fund-style alpha. Most institutions are only scratching the surface of what's possible.\n\nInstitutional investors may enhance their risk-return profile by moving beyond a monolithic view of crypto and recognizing three distinct segments: yield-generating strategies, directional investments, and alternative strategies.\n\nLike traditional fixed income, yield-generating strategies offer limited market risk with low volatility. Typical strategies range from tokenized money market funds that earn traditional yields to approaches engaging with the decentralized crypto finance ecosystem, which deliver attractive returns without traditional duration or credit risk.\n\nThese crypto yield strategies may boast attractive Sharpe ratios, rivalling high-yield bonds' risk premia but with different mechanics. For example, returns can be earned from protocol participation, lending and borrowing activities, funding rate arbitrage strategies, and liquidity provisioning. Unlike bonds that face principal erosion in rising rate environments, many crypto yield strategies function largely independently of central bank policy and provide genuine portfolio diversification precisely when it's most needed. However, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Crypto yield strategies entail risks, mainly centered around the maturity and security of the protocols and platforms a strategy engages with.\n\nThe path to institutional adoption typically follows three distinct approaches aligned with different investor profiles:\n\nContrary to early industry predictions, tokenization is progressing from liquid assets like stablecoins and money market funds upward, driven by liquidity and familiarity, not promises of democratizing illiquid assets. More complex assets are following suit, revealing a pragmatic adoption curve.\n\nMoody's caution about protocol risk exceeding traditional counterparty risk deserves scrutiny. This narrative may deter institutions from crypto's yield layer, yet it highlights only one side of the coin. While blockchain-based assets introduce technical risks, these risks are often transparent and auditable, unlike the potentially opaque risk profiles of counterparties in traditional finance.\n\nSmart contracts, for example, offer new levels of transparency. Their code can be audited, stress-tested, and verified independently. This means risk assessment can be conducted with fewer assumptions and greater precision than financial institutions with off-balance-sheet exposures. Major decentralized finance platforms now undergo multiple independent audits and maintain significant insurance reserves. They have, at least partially, mitigated risks in the public blockchain environment that Moody's warned against.\n\nWhile tokenization doesn't eliminate the inherent counterparty risk associated with the underlying assets, blockchain technology provides a more efficient and resilient infrastructure for accessing them.\n\nUltimately, institutional investors should apply traditional investment principles to these novel asset classes while acknowledging the vast array of opportunities within digital assets. The question isn't whether to allocate to crypto but rather which specific segments of the crypto asset universe align with particular portfolio objectives and risk tolerances. Institutional investors are well-positioned to develop tailored allocation strategies that leverage the unique characteristics of different segments of the crypto ecosystem.\n\n- Fabian Dori, chief investment officer, Sygnum Bank\n\nQ: What yield-generating strategies are institutions using on-chain today?\n\nA: The most promising strategies are delta-neutral, meaning they are neutral to price movements. This includes arbitrage between centralized and decentralized exchanges, capturing funding rates, and short-term lending across fragmented liquidity pools. These generate net yields of 7–15% without wider market exposure.\n\nQ: What structural features of DeFi enable more efficient capital deployment compared to traditional finance?\n\nA: We like to think of decentralized finance (DeFi) as “on-chain markets”. On-chain markets unlock capital efficiency by removing intermediaries, enabling programmable strategies, and offering real-time access to on-chain data. Unlike traditional finance, where capital often sits idle due to batch processing, counterparty delays, or opaque systems, on-chain markets provide a world where liquidity can be routed dynamically across protocols based on quantifiable risk and return metrics. Features like composability and permissionless access enable assets to be deployed, rebalanced, or withdrawn in real-time, often with automated safeguards. This architecture supports strategies that are both agile and transparent, particularly important for institutions that optimize across fragmented liquidity pools or manage volatility exposure.\n\nQ: How should a risk-averse institution approach yield on-chain?\n\nA: Many institutions exploring DeFi take a cautious first step by evaluating stablecoin-based, non-directional strategies, as explained above, that aim to offer consistent yields with limited market exposure. These approaches are often framed around capital preservation and transparency, with infrastructure that supports on-chain risk monitoring, customizable guardrails, and secure custody. For firms seeking yield diversification without the duration risk of traditional fixed income, these strategies are gaining traction as a conservative entry point into on-chain markets.\n\n- Abhishek Pingle, co-founder, Theo",
