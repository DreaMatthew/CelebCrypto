Notably, USDT netflows into exchanges reached the third-highest level ever recorded, exceeding $2.72 billion (on Ethereum alone),\" IntoTheBlock said in the weekly newsletter.\n\n\"This surge likely resulted from a combination of factors: traders depositing additional collateral to manage margin calls and prevent liquidations on underwater positions, alongside significant \"buy-the-dip\" activity, particularly focused on BTC,\" the firm added.\n\nBitcoin has since steaded between $95,000 and $100,000, CoinDesk data show.
