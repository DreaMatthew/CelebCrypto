    "content": "Hit TV series Peaky Blinders, which reached an estimated audience of 80 million through platforms like Netflix, is set to be adapted into a blockchain-based video game and wider Web3 ecosystem, the companies behind the effort announced on Thursday.\n\nIt is being developed by Anonymous Labs, a Web3 venture builder that previously launched the Simon’s Cat cartoon IP token. The company is partnering with Banijay Rights, the global distributor of Peaky Blinders, to expand the show’s presence into blockchain gaming and fan engagement tools.\n\nThe smoky streets of 1920s England are reimagined as a decentralized playground where fans can dive into high-stakes missions, craft their own Shelby-style legacy (the family the series is based around), and engage with the Peaky Blinders universe.\n\nThe game is being designed as an AAA title (a gaming buzzword where such products have extensive development budgets, large teams, and emphasis on high technical quality). It will feature digital collectibles and community engagement mechanisms that use blockchains.\n\nThe goal is to onboard traditional Peaky Blinders fans into crypto through interactive storytelling and gameplay.\n\n\"Peaky Blinders is arguably the biggest IP to date to embark on building a blockchain-based project, and I see this as a defining moment for the entire Web3 industry,” Wojciech Gruszka, head of Development at Peaky Blinders Web3 Game, said in a statement.\n\n“This project is not just about creating an incredible user experience—it’s a gateway to bringing blockchain new revenue streams and building brand loyalty in the Web3 space,” Gruszka added.\n\nSpecific details around token mechanics, launch timelines, or the game's economic structure have not been disclosed as of Thursday.",
