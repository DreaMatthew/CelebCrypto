    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\n, ether\nETH\n$3,515.90\nand the broader crypto market are facing renewed pressure, reversing some of gains made after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed concerns about tariff-driven inflation .\n\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly scheduled to speak at Blockworks' Digital Asset Summit in New York later, with traders keen to hear how the administration plans to acquire BTC in a budget-neutral manner. Don't get too excited, the likelihood of such an announcement remains low.\n\nTrump is more likely to reiterate his aspiration to make America the \"crypto capital of the world,\" and even this may overwhelm markets.\n\nOn a more positive note, renewed interest in U.S.-listed spot ETFs supports market strength. On Wednesday, bitcoin ETFs experienced a total net inflow of $11.8 million, a fourth consecutive day of positive flows, according to Farside Investors. In contrast, ether spot ETFs recorded a net outflow of $11.7 million, extending a streak of withdrawals to 11 straight days.\n\n\"Several catalysts continue to support a bullish outlook,\" Blockhead Research Network said. \"The U.S. government exploring budget-neutral ways to accumulate bitcoin could be a game-changing factor for this cycle. Additionally, solana futures being added to the CME is a major bullish indicator for altcoins, potentially increasing institutional exposure to SOL.\"\n\nSpeaking of on-chain flows, data from IntoTheBlock reveals that whales now hold some 62,000 more BTC than they did at the beginning of the month, indicating a resurgence in accumulation following nearly a year of declining balances. XRP whales have also been buying over the past two months.\n\nFor its part, the SUI token has remained resilient, looking to build on its Wednesday gains in the wake of Canary Capital Group, an institutional crypto trading and management firm, filing for a Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the SEC.\n\nIn wider market news, a domain claim page for Hyperlane, an open interoperability framework, surfaced, sparking speculation of a potential token airdrop on social media.\n\nTraditional markets offered mixed cues, with dollar-yen staring at a death cross pattern, teasing a major surge ahead in the Japanese currency, which is seen as an anti-risk holding. Meanwhile, copper neared a record high in a positive sign for risky assets. Stay alert!\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
