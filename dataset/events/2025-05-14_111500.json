    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nInvestors are still rotating money into altcoins, lifting valuations for ETH, RAY, ENA, MKR and other tokens while leaving bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nlittle changed above $100,000.\n\nWhile the biggest cryptocurrency by market value is just 7% short of hitting a new high, its 30-day options-based implied or expected volatility, represented by Deribit's DVOL index, is hovering near the lowest level since June 2024.\n\nThis type of calm usually precedes big moves. Georgii Verbitskii, a market analyst and founder of TYMIO, a crypto investor app put it best: \"Options implied volatility is extremely low, the market doesn't seem to believe in strong moves, and 1- to 3-month option pricing is still cheap. That kind of complacency often precedes a big move.\"\n\nBTC could quickly break through $115,000, Verbitskii said, noting that, \"If the liquidity thesis holds — where global liquidity supports bitcoin — we could see that breakout as early as May.\" Just to remind you, bitcoin hit a record high around $109,000 in January.\n\nStill, the market faces potential headwinds. For instance, the U.S. Senate has its last opportunity to pass the bipartisan GENIUS Act, a bill introduced in February that calls for issuers to back digital currencies with safe reserves and report them monthly or deal with penalties. The bill was unable to advance in a recent vote. According to the Senate's rules another failure will kill the bill unless all senators agree to reconsider, according to Tagus Capital.\n\nFurther, the U.S. SEC delayed a decision on Tuesday on whether to allow in-kind redemptions for BlackRock's bitcoin exchange-traded fund while it asks for feedback.\n\nIn other news, DeFi Development Corp. purchased 172,670 SOL worth roughly $23.6 million, bringing its total Solana Treasury holdings to over $100 million.\n\nThat's less common, with more companies running to bitcoin: An update from bitcoin-focused company River points out: \"Thousands of companies across all sectors are using bitcoin to offset inflation and build up their treasury.\" Stay alert!\n\nCoinDesk's Consensus is taking place in Toronto on May 14-16. Use code DAYBOOK and save 15% on passes.\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nStrategy (MSTR): closed on Tuesday at $421.61 (+4.13%), down 2.29% at $411.96 in pre-market\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN): closed at $256.9 (+23.97%), down 1.38% at $253.36\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY): closed at $29.39 (+3.52%)\n\nMARA Holdings (MARA): closed at $16.37 (+2.63%), down 1.53% at $16.12\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT): closed at $9.06 (+4.14%), down 1.1% at $8.96\n\nCore Scientific (CORZ): closed at $10.24 (+3.64%), down 0.68% at $10.17\n\nCleanSpark (CLSK): closed at $10 (+3.95%), down 2.4% at $9.76\n\nCoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI): closed at $17.20 (+5.26%)\n\nSemler Scientific (SMLR): closed at $36.70 (+5.34%), down 0.93% at $36.36\n\nExodus Movement (EXOD): closed at $42.04 (-22.58%), unchanged in pre-market\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
