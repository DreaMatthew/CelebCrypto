    "content": "Crypto Twitter may sometimes seem like a raging brawl, but come Feb. 20, there will be some actual live combat between crypto influencers at Consensus Hong Kong 2025.\n\nThe conference will play host that evening to the eighth edition of Crypto Fight Night (CFN), an industry sporting and networking event that’s become hugely popular since holding its first event in 2021. At the most recent CFN held in Dubai in December, popular crypto YouTuber Bitboy squared off against memecoin trader and influencer Ansem in a dramatic fight that went to the last round and ended in a draw. The bout drew a record one million live streams.\n\nRead more: Ansem: The Memecoin King\n\nRahul Suri, one of CFN’s co-founders, said the organizers were initially looking for new ways to connect crypto enthusiasts in person as the world was emerging from the pandemic.\n\nExhibition boxing seemed like a natural fit, given the individualistic and competitive ethos of both arenas, Suri said.\n\n“Crypto is a very player-versus-player environment, and combined with the risk-taking attitude of the general crypto participant, boxing has become a very highly-desired sport,” said Suri, who also runs Ghaf Capital, a private investment firm based in Dubai. “The fights at Crypto Fight Night are more than just entertainment — they’re a gateway to the crypto world.”\n\nAt Consensus Hong Kong, roughly 500 people, all of whom have signed up for VIP tickets, are expected to attend the roughly three-hour event. It will be held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, which is attached to the conference’s main venue, the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. And like all CFN events, the bouts will be live streamed on CFN’s X and YouTube accounts.\n\nThe main event will be a fight between crypto influencers Bitlord, who has more than 400,000 followers on X, and Korean Jew, a crypto market analyst with close to 150,000 X followers. The winner of that bout will be awarded the coveted CFN Crypto Belt.\n\nAnother highly-anticipated fight will be a contest between YouTube giants My Mate Nate, a content creator with almost 15 million subscribers on YouTube who’s known as the Mr. Beast of Thailand, and charismatic CFN veteran DawoodSAVAGE. There will also be several bouts between boxers with semi-professional experience.\n\nAnd awards for “Fight of the Night,” as well as “BONK of the Night” for the best punch landed (and a nod to the popular memecoin) will be announced on social media after the event.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong.
