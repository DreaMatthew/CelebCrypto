Having used up nearly all of its previous $21 billion common stock offering with its most recent BTC buys last week, the company also announced a fresh $21 billion at-the-market offering.\n\nTurning to its software business, revenue for the quarter fell 3.6% to $111.1 million from $115.2 million the year before. Subscription services revenue for the quarter came in at $37.1 million, compared with $23.0 million in the year prior.\n\nDuring the quarter, Strategy achieved an 11.0% \"BTC Yield\", reflecting growth in bitcoin holdings relative to diluted shares outstanding. The \"BTC $ Gain\" for the quarter was around $4.1 billion, moving the company closer toward its target of a $10 billion gain for the year.\n\nThe company lifted its long-term target for BTC Yield to 25% from 15% and for BTC $ Gain to $15 billion from $10 billion.\n\nShares of the company are trading 27% higher year-to-date. Bitcoin is trading around $96,547, about 2.5% higher over the past 24 hours.\n\nIncluding April purchases, the company holds 553,555 bitcoin acquired for $37.9 billion or $68,459 each. That stack is worth roughly $53 billion at the current price.\n\n“Our capital markets strategy continues to grow our Bitcoin holdings while delivering superior shareholder value. With over 70 public companies worldwide now adopting a Bitcoin treasury standard, we are proud to be at the forefront in pioneering this space.” Phong Le, president and CEO of Strategy, said in a statement.\n\nShares are marginally higher in after hours trading.",
