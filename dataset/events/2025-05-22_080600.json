    "content": "Bitcoin's\nBTC\n$101,754.63\ndollar high succumbed on Thursday as the largest cryptocurrency rose past $111,800, a remarkable 50% gain from its April low near $75,000, but when measured against traditional stores of value like gold and silver, BTC — often dubbed \"digital gold\" — still has room to advance.\n\nThe bitcoin-to-gold ratio stands at 33.27 ounces, below its January peak of over 40 oz. BTC has also not reached an all-time high against silver, though it has just breached the 3,300 oz. level, compared with the record 3,530 oz.\n\nThe digital gold moniker reflects bitcoin's fixed supply and decentralized nature, and it's increasingly living up to the name. In recent weeks, it has outperformed U.S. equities, which remain sluggish for the year despite recovering from their April tariff-tantrum induced downturn.\n\nIn fiat terms, bitcoin is nearing significant psychological milestones across other currencies too. It currently trades around 82,500 British pounds, just shy of its all-time high of 88,300 pounds, and at 91,500 Swiss francs, versus a previous peak just under 100,000 francs. These levels hint at imminent breakthroughs as bitcoin gains further strength.\n\nNotably, BTC has already achieved all-time highs relative to major financial instruments like the Nasdaq 100 and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). Its continued outperformance of both bonds and tech stocks underscores a broader trend. The final frontier remains precious metals. Surpassing gold and silver benchmarks will mark a complete reversal of monetary dominance.",
