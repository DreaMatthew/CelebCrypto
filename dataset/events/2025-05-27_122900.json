    "content": "Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider, is expanding into parts of Africa where crypto regulation is beginning to solidify.\n\nThe company is focusing on Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa, and plans to open a physical office in Nigeria this quarter, citing it as its fastest-growing market in West Africa, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNigeria recently passed a new investment and securities law, which includes provisions for licensing and regulating cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n“Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” said Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa. “Applying for a crypto-exchange license in Nigeria is a top priority.”\n\nOther countries are also laying the groundwork. The Bank of Ghana released draft guidelines last year . Kenya, meanwhile, is still in the research phase to further understand the asset class.\n\nThe move comes after earlier this year Blockchain.com took a new step towards a potential initial public offering (IPO) through new executive appointments.\n\nThat comes as Circle Internet group, the firm behind the USDC stablecoin, filed for an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange as an increasing number of crypto firms look to go public.\n\nRead more: Stablecoin Giant Circle Files for IPO on NYSE",
