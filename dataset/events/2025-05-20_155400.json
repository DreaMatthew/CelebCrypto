The document was signed by Milei and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona.\n\nThe unit received assistance from a series of government agencies in the course of its investigation, including the Argentinian central bank and the anti-corruption office.\n\nIn February Milei tweeted about LIBRA, a Solana-based memecoin; the coin's market capitalization rose to $4.5 billion before tanking more than 80% in a couple of hours.\n\nLIBRA's co-creator, Hayden Davies, had previously claimed to that he could \"control\" Milei because of payments he'd made to the President's sister, Karina, herself an important figure of Milei's government.",
