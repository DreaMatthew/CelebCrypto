    "content": "The Bitcoin network hashrate, a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty, rose slightly in January, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Monday.\n\nThe monthly average network hashrate rose 1% to 785 exahashes per second (EH/s), the bank noted, while mining difficulty fell 2% month-on-month.\n\nThe month-end, weekly moving average hashrate was 781 EH/s, a 2% decline from the end of December, the report said.\n\n\"This is relatively uncommon, and a modest tailwind for bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nmining economics,\" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, adding that network difficulty remains 25% higher than before the halving event last April.\n\nAccording to a CoinDesk report from Tuesday, Bitcoin's 7-day moving average hashrate hit an all-time high of 833 exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nMining profitability also inched higher in January. The bank estimated that miners earned an average of $57,200 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue, an increase of less than 1% from December.\n\nThe total market cap of the bitcoin miners that the bank tracks rose 5% from the month previous.\n\nCipher Mining (CIFR) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) outperformed, gaining 23% and 16% respectively, after announcing high performance computing (HPC) related news.\n\nTeraWulf (WULF) underperformed in January, with the shares dropping 16%.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Miners Bitdeer, CleanSpark, Core Scientific Initiated at Outperform by KBW",
