    "content": "Dutch bank ABN AMRO has conducted an onchain trade of tokenized assets against stablecoins alongside Germany-regulated 21X.\n\nThe two firms completed a joint proof of concept (PoC) for the issuing of a token on the Polygon Amoy Testnet, which was listed as a trading pair with an e-money token, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday.\n\n\"The deployment of 21X's on-chain order book smart contract enabled trading between tokenized cash and the tokenized asset in one single transaction,\" the firms said.\n\nFrankfurt-based 21X, which is building a blockchain-based exchange to list and trade tokenized securities, won approval from German regulator BaFin in December.\n\nTokenization - the representation of real-world assets such as stocks or bonds as tokens on a blockchain - has become an area of interest among traditional financial (TradFi) firms in recent years.\n\nBlockchain-native companies such as 21X securing regulatory approval in major financial centers means TradFi companies can enter partnerships with them to advance their tokenization plans with greater confidence.\n\nRead More: What 2025 Holds for Tokenized Real World Assets",
