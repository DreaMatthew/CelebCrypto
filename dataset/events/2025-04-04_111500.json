    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nMajor coins reversed early gains after Beijing stepped up trade tensions by announcing retaliatory tariffs following President Donald Trump's Wednesday decision to impose additional levies on China and other nations.\n\nBitcoin dropped to $83,000 from $84,600, though the downside appeared limited, probably because the market's worst fears have finally come true. Markets dislike uncertainty, and the anticipation of a looming threat often creates more anxiety and fear than the actual realization of that threat.\n\nSince Trump took office on Jan. 20, markets have been wrestling with the threat of tariffs and a global trade war. That damped investor risk appetite, causing the BTC price to tumble from a record high over $109,000 to below $80,000 last month.\n\nThis week, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations, with higher levies on China, the European Union and Southeast Asia. The effective U.S. tariff rate is now above the level of around 20% set by the 1930's Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.\n\nThis so-called tariffagedon moment marks the end of lingering uncertainty and could be liberating for markets, mainly because bond yields have dropped across the advanced world in the aftermath, pricing in disinflation. That's contrary to the popular narrative that tariffs would lead to stagflation — high inflation plus low growth — forcing the Fed to keep interest rates elevated.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yield has dropped below 4% for the first time since October and yields have fallen sharply in the U.K., Germany and Japan. Plus, oil has declined sharply this week on prospects of higher supply from OPEC countries.\n\nAll this bodes well for Fed rate cut bets and risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The same can be said for Friday's March jobs report, which, if it beats estimates, will likely be seen as backward-looking, failing to account for this week's Trump tariffs, while a weak print will only add to Fed rate cuts.\n\nWith the major macro uncertainty behind us, the crypto market could return to focusing on positive developments, such as USDC issuer Circle's IPO filing and technological advancements.\n\nOn Thursday, Coinbase Derivatives submitted documentation to the CFTC to self-certify futures for XRP. In addition, Ethereum developers chose May 7 as the date for the Pectra upgrade to go live on the mainnet.\n\nElsewhere, the SEC acknowledged Fidelity's filing for a spot exchange-traded fund tied to SOL, which takes it closer to approval. A lot is happening within the industry, so stay alert!\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
