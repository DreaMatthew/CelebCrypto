    "content": "Rapper Soulja Boy will no longer perform at Stand With Crypto's \"get out the vote\" event in Jersey City next week due to a court finding him liable for sexual battery and assault, a spokesperson told CoinDesk on Thursday.\n\nSoulja Boy, otherwise known as DeAndre Cortez Way, and 070 Shake, otherwise known as Danielle Balbuena, were slated to headline the event on June 5, which was intended to bring out crypto fans a few weeks before New Jersey residents go to the polls to choose their nominees for the Garden State's governor race, Stand With Crypto announced on Wednesday.\n\nStand With Crypto New Jersey chapter president Carlos Merino said in a statement that \"This GOTV rally is one more example of Stand With Crypto's commitment to mobilizing the crypto community ahead of New Jersey's critical gubernatorial primary election.\"\n\nHowever, Way will no longer perform after Politico reported Thursday morning that he was recently ordered to pay a former assistant $4 million after being found liable for sexual battery and assault.\n\nAn external spokesperson for Stand With Crypto said in a statement that the organization was \"not aware of the recent legal developments involving Soulja Boy.\"\n\n\"Given this information, we have removed him from our event lineup. 070 Shake will still perform at our June 5th rally and we look forward to bringing together New Jersey's crypto community to demonstrate the political power of crypto voters ahead of the gubernatorial primary,\" according to the statement.\n\n\"Our focus remains on mobilizing crypto supporters and ensuring candidates understand that clear, sensible crypto policy is a priority for New Jersey voters.\"\n\nThe lawsuit against Way dates back to 2021, though the jury ruling only came last month. Way said he would appeal the ruling, according to Courthouse News Service.\n\nWay also performed at the \"Crypto Ball,\" an inauguration event sponsored by MAGA Inc. and Bitcoin Inc., as well as Crypto.com, Exodus, Anchorage Digital and Kraken back in January.",
