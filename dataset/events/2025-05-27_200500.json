Payments are then settled in near real-time via the Lighting Network while Square handles real-time exchange rate calculations and confirmation notifications, according to a press release.\n\nSquare hopes to make the feature available to a broader audience later this year and to all customers by 2026, pending regulatory approval.\n\n“We believe in an open, decentralized, fair, fast, and low-cost money system for everyone, and that’s exactly what we want to bring to Square sellers,” said Miles Suter, Bitcoin Product Lead at Block (XYZ), the parent company of Square.",
