    "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the crypto world on Sunday night with the announcement of a crypto strategic reserve plan that includes XRP, Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL — later adding bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,810.99\nand ether\nETH\n$3,483.27\nto the mix.\n\nTrump has been discussing the idea of a strategic crypto reserve since his 2024 presidential campaign. Soon after taking office in January, he signed an executive order directing a working group to evaluate the formation of a strategic crypto reserve, but the order did not explicitly mandate that the U.S. establish one outright.\n\nThe order said the digital assets working group should \"evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile.\" Trump said on Sunday that the group should \"move forward\" with formally establishing the reserve. The working group will host a summit on Friday with crypto industry and government representatives.\n\nThat instantly riled up markets, as ADA and XRP shot up as much as 60%, and bitcoin reversed a chunk of last week’s losses with a move above the $93,000 level. Traders cautioned against increasing exposure to the market after the sudden move as concrete details on the reserve are finalized, with all eyes on the first-ever White House Crypto Summit scheduled for Mar.7.\n\nWhile traders remain focused on prices, here’s what crypto industry leaders say about the long-term implications and impact of the possible strategic reserve plans.\n\n\"I imagined a Strategic Reserve would be just bitcoin. That makes the most sense to me.\n\nMany crypto assets have merits, but what we're talking about here isn't a US investment portfolio — we're talking about a reserve, and Bitcoin is the undisputed store of value for the digital age.\n\nOf course, I'm grateful the new administration is so constructive on the space. I look forward to learning more about thinking here.\"\n\n\"I’ve said this before - the crypto industry will achieve our goals (and beyond), IF WE WORK TOGETHER. Appreciate the crypto President @realDonaldTrump’s vision of a govt digital asset reserve representative of the industry.\n\nMaximalism is the enemy of the industry’s progress. Glad to see POTUS recognizing we live in a multichain world and that we’re finally moving past Bill Hinman and the Biden administration's SEC’s very broken thinking.\n\nI will certainly continue to champion this while in Washington at the end of this week.\"\n\n\"Excited to learn more. Still forming an opinion on asset allocation, but my current thinking is:\n\n1. Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option - simplest, and clear story as successor to gold.\n\n2. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto assets to keep it unbiased.\n\nBut probably option #1 is easiest\"\n\n\"I get the rationale for a Bitcoin reserve. I don't agree with it, but I get it. We have a gold reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold, which is better than analog gold. So let's create a Bitcoin reserve too. But what's the rationale for an XRP reserve? Why the hell would we need that?\"\n\n\"Nothing new here. Just words. Lmk when they get congressional approval to borrow money and or revalue the gold price higher. Without that they have no money to buy #bitcoin and #shitcoins.\"\n\n\"This move signals recognition of cryptocurrencies' value and contribution to the national economy, their role in economic strategy, and the growing recognition of blockchain's potential to drive innovation in the global shift to a digital economy.\n\nThe U.S. crypto reserve could play an important role in stabilizing volatility, providing legitimacy, and democratizing access to crypto assets. It could also pave the way for clearer regulatory guidelines, which key industry players have long advocated.\n\nHistorically, strategic reserves have significantly driven demand for commodities like crude oil and gold. Institutional and central bank interest in gold led to a 26% price increase in 2024, and a similar effect could be seen for crypto assets with strong technological foundations and real-world applications.\"\n\n\"We are surprised to see digital assets other than Bitcoin included in the strategic reserve, as they differ significantly in nature. Unlike Bitcoin, which serves as a fixed-supply asset that can help hedge against a depreciating fiat currency, these assets are akin to tech investments.\n\nThe announcement suggests a more patriotic stance toward the broader crypto technology space, with little regard for the fundamental qualities of these assets.\"\n\n\"President Trump’s strategic reserve announcement was intriguingly timed—dropping on a Sunday against a battered market backdrop, and highlighting XRP, ADA, and SOL before BTC and ETH.\n\nWhile most expected a ‘bitcoin-only’ approach, this pivot underscores digital assets’ multi-dimensional potential, paving the way for advanced settlement solutions and bridging global finance. It’s a strategic move that could forge new partnerships and inspire more robust infrastructure for large-scale adoption.\n\nCall it a ‘Trump index fund’ or a ‘US index fund’—it showcases the versatility and resilience of this evolving market. This move sets a powerful precedent for the future of digital finance, proving there’s room at the table for a variety of tokens and technologies.\"\nRead more: Crypto Daybook Americas: Trump's Reserve Shock Revives Cautious $100K BTC Hope\nThis is a running list of comments from crypto industry leaders, updated regularly.",
