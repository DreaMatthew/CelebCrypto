    "content": "South Korea's 7-Eleven stores are now accepting the Bank of Korea’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) as part of a limited-time test that runs through June.\n\nThe company is participating in the “Hangang Project” pilot of the CBDC. Customers with accounts at one of seven partner banks — including Kookmin, Shinhan and Woori — can pay for items at checkout by scanning a QR code from their digital wallet, similar to how many use mobile payment apps, according to local news outlet Enews Today.\n\nTo encourage participation, 7-Eleven is offering a 10% discount on all products when purchased with the digital currency during the trial period.\n\nMoon Dae-woo, head of digital innovation at 7-Eleven, said the retailer is experimenting with new technologies to improve store efficiency.\n\n“By participating in this digital currency payment test, we’ve taken another step forward in digital transformation,” he said in a statement.\n\nThe pilot is one of the first real-world trials of a central bank digital currency in a retail setting in South Korea. It comes after the country’s central bank governor said there was “urgency” in the introduction of a CBDC.\n\nDisclaimer: Information gathered for this story was translated with the use of artificial intelligence.",
