    "summary": "After a digital assets pullback in the U.S. over the past two years, Jump is accelerating crypto trading globally and bumping up headcount, people familiar with the matter said.",
    "content": "Chicago-based trading giant Jump is returning its cryptocurrency operations to full strength after scaling it back in the U.S. over the past couple of years due to regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty.\n\nWhile Jump has maintained its digital assets trading and market-making activity in other parts of the globe, crypto trading volume is now accelerating globally, according to a person familiar with the situation. In addition, Jump is looking to hire a clutch of crypto engineers and plans to start filling U.S. policy and governmental liaison roles in due course, a second person said.\n\nThe previous U.S. administration, aided and abetted by anti-crypto regulators and weaponized banking authorities, did its best to choke off the digital assets sector across the States—a situation rapidly reversed under Donald Trump.\n\nRead more: As the SEC Continues Its Crypto Litigation Retreat, Here’s What’s Still Outstanding\n\nJump found itself at the center of regulatory scrutiny in the wake of the collapse of the Terra Luna stablecoin and FTX. This led to reports of a pullback in the U.S., including the spin-out of Jump’s Wormhole project and a halving of headcount at the Jump Crypto division, which had peaked at about 150 staffers in 2022, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAn interesting proposition for Jump would be participation in the U.S. crypto ETF space, where the firm has remained conspicuously absent.\n\nLooking ahead, a solana\nSOL\n$168.08\nETF is likely to be granted at some point; Jump is known for its investment and development work in the Solana ecosystem, such as with projects like Firedancer, software designed to improve transaction throughput on the blockchain.\n\nJump declined to comment.\n\nRead more: Jump Crypto Adds $10M to Industry's U.S. Political War Chest, Raising PAC to $169M\n\nUpdate: Adds that Jump is accelerating crypto trading globally.\n\nUpdate: Jump handles its crypto trading out of London and not the US where the focus has been on R&D",
