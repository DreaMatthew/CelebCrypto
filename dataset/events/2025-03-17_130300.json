In the U.S., bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nexchange-traded funds (ETFs) logged the longest streak of weekly outflows since their January 2024 debut, with investors pulling more than $5.4 billion over the past five weeks.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump has shown support for cryptocurrencies, including with the order for the establishment of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, that support has so far failed to counteract concerns about tariff-induced trade tensions and monetary policy.\n\nBitcoin has dropped more than 21% over the last three months to around $83,000, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has lost around 34.6% of its value over the same period.",
