    "content": "Vaulta, formerly known as EOS Network, and its digital banking platform have teamed up with Fosun Wealth Holdings to bring blockchain infrastructure to Hong Kong’s financial sector, the companies said.\n\nThe partnership centers around “FinChain,” a virtual asset business launched by Fosun Wealth Holdings, which is part of the Fosun International conglomerate.\n\nThat conglomerate includes various businesses, including regional insurance and healthcare leaders in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.\n\nVaulta will supply its full BankingOS suite, while exSat, Vaulta’s digital banking platform, will serve as the on-chain banking layer for asset issuance, yield generation, and crypto payments, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nThe deal allows Vaulta and exSat to tap into Fosun’s existing financial licenses and real-world asset (RWA) issuance capabilities, giving them a regulatory springboard to scale blockchain-native banking services.\n\nFor Zhao Chen, Director of Digital Assets at Fosun Wealth, the collaboration brings the necessary infrastructure to roll out next-gen financial products.\n\n\"Vaulta and exSat bring the product vision and digital banking capabilities we need to make FinChain a reality,\" he said in the announcement.\n\nThe initiative is part of Vaulta’s broader rebrand and expansion into institutional-grade blockchain finance. The partnership is expected to lead to more collaborations focused on Web3 financial infrastructure across Asia and beyond.",
