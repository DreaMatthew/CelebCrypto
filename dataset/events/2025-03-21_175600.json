    "content": "Animal spirits in the crypto industry continue to be evident amid the eased regulatory stance of the Trump administration, with leading U.S. spot exchange Coinbase (COIN) in advanced acquisition talks with leading global derivatives exchange Deribit, reports Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to the story, the companies have notified Dubai regulators (where Deribit is licensed) about the discussions.\n\nBloomberg earlier this year — alongside rumors that Kraken was discussing an acquisition of Deribit — reported Deribit could be valued in the area of $4 billion to $5 billion.\n\nMostly known for its spot trading business, Coinbase (COIN) would be making a big push into the highly profitable crypto derivatives market with a purchase of Deribit, which saw trading volume in 2024 of nearly $1.2 trillion — almost double that of the year prior.\n\nEarlier this week, another U.S. crypto exchange — Kraken — boosted its derivatives business with a $1.5 billion deal to purchase Ninja Trader.",
