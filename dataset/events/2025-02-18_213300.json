Companies, however, were allowed to adopt the rule prior to that at their own discretion.\n\nSemler as of today continued to hold 3,192 bitcoin worth more than $300 million at bitcoin's current price of about $95,000. The company's aggregate purchase price was $280.4 million.\n\nShares were higher by 2.1% in the regular session on Tuesday.
