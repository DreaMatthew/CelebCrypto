    "content": "Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products under new rules, aimed at curbing insider trading in the digital asset market, per a Nikkei report on Sunday.\n\nThe move comes as part of a broader effort to strengthen oversight in Japan's crypto ecosystem, which has witnessed growing adoption alongside a rise in fraudulent activities.\n\nThe FSA intends to submit amendments to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA) to Japan's parliament as early as 2026, following a detailed review conducted by experts behind closed doors.\n\nCryptocurrencies are currently categorized as a \"means of settlement\" under the Payment Services Act, a designation that has governed their use primarily as a payment tool rather than as investment vehicles.\n\nHowever, this existing classification has left gaps in regulatory oversight, particularly concerning activities like insider trading.\n\nAs such, specific details about the insider trading rules — such as what constitutes insider information in the crypto context or the penalties for violations — have not yet been disclosed, leaving room for further clarification as the proposal takes shape.",
