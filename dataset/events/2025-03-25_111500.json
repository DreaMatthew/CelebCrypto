    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nRisk-assets have a spring in their step. Bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nis trading above $87,000 and the S&P 500 reclaimed its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 10.\n\nHowever, volatility is expected to rise ahead of Friday’s quarterly options expiry, with over $12 billion in notional value set to expire on Deribit with a max pain price at $85,000. Most open interest, meantime, centers around $100,000 call options.\n\nPresident Trump is deploying new trade war tactics, introducing “secondary tariffs” that could impose a 25% levy on any nation buying oil and gas from Venezuela, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHe also signaled that while some countries may receive exemptions on tariffs, additional tariffs on autos, lumber and semiconductor chips will be announced in the coming days. These measures, part of the president's broader “America First” economic agenda, could take effect as early as April 2.\n\nBloomberg notes that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent continues to advocate for tariffs, framing them as a strategic tool that serves multiple purposes: providing leverage in negotiations, generating government revenue and rebalancing trade in favor of the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.K., Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing for Wednesday's Spring Statement amid rising bond yields that threaten to complicate fiscal planning. Early reports indicate she will propose civil service job cuts while ruling out further tax increases.
