    "content": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) asked for crypto industry help in tracking and blocking transactions intended to launder the $1.5 billion stolen from Bybit by North Korean hackers.\n\nThe FBI published a list of Ethereum addresses that are holding or have held assets from the theft in a public service announcement on Wednesday. The announcement reiterated the country's involvement and labeled it a TraderTraitor activity.\n\nThe hack had already been attributed to the North Korea-linked Lazarus group by blockchain analytics firms. The ether and ETH staking tokens were stolen in the largest ever hack of a crypto exchange last week.\n\nThe illicit actors are converting some of their stolen assets to bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,880.85\nand other cryptocurrencies \"across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains,\" the PSA said. The FBI said it expects the assets to be laundered further and eventually converted to fiat currency.\n\nRead More: Bybit Declares ‘War on Lazarus’ as It Crowdsources Effort to Freeze Stolen Funds",
