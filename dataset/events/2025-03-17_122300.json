The so-called \"BTC yield\" is 6.9% year-to-date, according to Strategy.\n\nCompany holdings are now 499,226 bitcoin acquired for a total of $33.1 billion, or an average cost of $66,360 per token.\n\nThis latest purchase was funded by the sale of 123,000 shares of STRK, which generated about $10.7 million of net proceeds. Strategy last week announced a mammoth $21 billion at-the-market offering of that preferred stock.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
