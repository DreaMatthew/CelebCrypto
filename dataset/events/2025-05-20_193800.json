The council will be composed of individuals from the industry, with a chair to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We want to use technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today,\" Adams said in his opening remarks. \"We have experts right here, and they are going to help us navigate solutions that serve our city. We are lucky to have this type of human capital right here in the city of New York.\"\n\nThe summit, which included a public press conference followed by closed-door roundtables, had participants from both family offices and unicorn startups, said Richard Hecker of Traction and Scale, a logistics firm involved in the event.\n\nBusiness interests aside, the city will explore putting birth and death records onto a blockchain to help New Yorkers' next of kin easily access these types of documents, Adams said.\n\nAndrew Durgee, the co-CEO of Republic, which backs other startups financially, noted that his firm remained in New York despite concerns about regulators and other issues, even as other firms left the country.\n\n\"Now the first time in 15 years, we're in this scenario, we have no idea what it's going to look like,\" Durgee said. \"You have now all these people, these smart, brilliant people now coming back to the U.S., and they're looking for a place to land.\"",
