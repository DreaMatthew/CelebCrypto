    "content": "Bitcoin and broader crypto markets were little changed in the past 24 hours with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset attracting over $590 million in inflows on Monday, extending a six-day streak.\n\nThat marked a week of inflows for the first time since late March, coming as bitcoin’s appeal as a safe-haven asset continues to gain favor among investors. BlackRock’s IBIT led flows at $970 million, while Ark’s ARKB lost $200 million. BTC held above $94,000 in Asian morning hours on Tuesday, a resistance level whose break traders say could clear the path to a move toward $100,000.\n\nXRP, ether\nETH\n$3,333.69\n, Cardano’s ADA and BNB Chain’s BNB remained flat, while Solana’s SOL was down 2%.\nXMR\n$345.49\ndropped 8.5% after a sudden 40% surge on Monday, a move that came as a hacker swapped over $330 million of BTC to the privacy-focused token, per prominent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT.\n\nAmong mid-caps,\nNEXO\n$1.0484\nzoomed 8% after announcing it would return to the U.S. after a two-year regulatory hiatus with a focus on AI applications.\n\nSome traders eye data releases in the week ahead for cues on positioning, with market sentiment generally dented after U.S. tariffs.\n\n“Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have sustained gains made last week. Right now, traders are waiting for GDP, unemployment data, and a number of other economic data indicators set to be released in the US this week, so not much has changed yet,” Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\n“The US dollar continues to dip, as institutional investors diversify their holdings into other currencies. This could explain why demand for Bitcoin has been strong as well,” Mei added. The widely-tracked dollar index, a measure of the greenback against six global currencies, is down nearly 6% in the past month — its biggest fall since 2022.\n\nElsewhere, a correlation between bitcoin and an increase in M2 money supply is gaining traction among some traders. However, responses to viral online posts overlaying the two charts appear to be overblown in their eventual impact on prices.\n\nM2 supply is the total amount of money in an economy, including cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, and other easily accessible funds. Bitcoin prices can rise if M2 increases because people may buy BTC to protect their wealth from inflation. Conversely, if M2 shrinks, bitcoin prices might drop since investors shy away from riskier bets.\n\n“One of the recent and prevailing narratives suggests that BTC is about to break higher as a delayed reaction to the increase in M2 money supply,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\n“While we are not strict subscribers to this view as there are a lot more nuances behind the data, we are bullish on BTC in the medium term due to expectations of monetary and fiscal easing in response to tariff-driven slowdowns,” Fan added.",
