    "summary": "The “mog/acc” is quickly gaining ground among everyone from Elon Musk to Garry Tan, a move that bumps the project’s visibility - and eventually prices.",
    "content": "Move over dogecoin. The new memecoin making waves in tech Twitter’s inner sanctum isn’t just about fun; it’s about mindset.\n\nMOG Coin, a popular token offered on Ethereum and Base, is trying to bring in a cultural shift as “mog/acc” — a mashup of mogging (a slang for being better, stronger, faster) and accelerationism (speeding up technological change at all costs).\n\nTechno-optimists are quickly putting on Pit Vipers, a flashy sunglass brand, as their X account display, which is leading to mindshare of the mog token outside of crypto circles.\n\nInfluential X accounts from Y Combinator founder Garry Tan to owner Elon Musk have all joined the mog/acc train, changing their displays to one wearing a Pit Viper. MOG prices are up more than 11% in the past week, extending 30-day gains to over 130%.\n\nSolana ecosystem firms like Raydium and Jupiter have joined in, changing their online displays to a cat or their mascot wearing Pit Vipers and stating “mog/acc.”\n\nAlways be mogging https://t.co/9wk7rUYAvi\n\nA community member has even built a mog/acc bot that automatically converts any display into the aesthetic the mog/acc believers strive for, with the account going viral hours after launching in the wee hours of Wednesday.",
