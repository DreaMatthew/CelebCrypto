    "content": "Another company has elected to add bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,558.40\nto its balance sheet.\n\nChristian Angermayer, the chairman of Germany-based biopharmaceutical company atai Life Sciences (ATAI) announced today that the firm would develop its own bitcoin treasury strategy.\n\n“In an era of persistent inflation and volatile markets, I find myself asking an important question for biotech companies looking to preserve and optimize the capital they have: Could allocating a portion of treasury cash to bitcoin help preserve, optimize, and even extend a company’s runway and hence contribute to its success,” Angermayer wrote on Substack.\n\nThe company will initially invest $5 million in bitcoin, Angermayer said, while holding enough cash, short-term securities and public equity for operational expenses into 2027.\n\nThe pharmaceutical firm is the latest in a long line of corporations which have sought to replicate Michael Saylor’s bitcoin treasury strategy.\n\nATAI briefly surged when the news broke but is now down 2.8% for the day. After briefly topping $87,000 overnight, bitcoin has been in quick retreat, now changing hands at $83,900, lower by about 1% over the past 24 hours.",
