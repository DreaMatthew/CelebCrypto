    "content": "Crypto exchange Bybit is no longer illegally operating in France in the eyes of the country's financial regulator, its CEO said Friday.\n\nThe exchange was on France's regulatory blacklist for more than two years, Ben Zhou, the CEO of Bybit, said in an X post on Friday.\n\n\"After more than two years of working with the French regulator through multiple remediation efforts, BYBIT is now officially removed from France AMF blacklist,\" he said.\n\nA search of the Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF) database confirms that Bybit, the second largest global exchange by volume, is no longer on the blacklist.\n\nJust last May the regulator was advising people that Bybit was not registered to operate in the country and encouraged investors to make arrangements so that the platform eventually \"ceases.\" Soon after the notice, Bybit said it would stop offering products to French nationals.\n\nBut now the exchange's CEO is hopeful it will be able to get a Markets in Crypto Assets license (MiCA).\n\n\"MiCA license next,\" Zhou said on X. Companies are striving to get the coveted MiCA license, which would let them operate across the 30 European Economic Area nations.\n\nThe Dubai-based exchange knows how to make a comeback after receiving warnings from regulators. Recently, Bybit managed to secure a license in India after paying a $1 million fine.\n\nNeither Bybit nor the AMF returned requests for comment.",
