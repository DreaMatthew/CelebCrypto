Last month, the exchange revealed its cryptocurrency trading business had exploded in recent years and now accounts for 25% of its overall revenue.\n\nThe tie-up is part of Boerse Stuttgart’s plans to expand partnerships with “additional European banks, brokers, and asset managers, further contributing to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.”\n\nThe exchange has said that cryptocurrency trading volumes “almost tripled” last year to mark their best performance year-to-date. It holds around 4.3 billion euros ($4.45 billion) in custody.",
