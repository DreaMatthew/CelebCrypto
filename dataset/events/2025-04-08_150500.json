    "summary": "Spiteri worked for the crypto asset manager in London for over five years.",
    "content": "Frank Spiteri, head of asset management at CoinShares (CS), left the crypto investment manager recently, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nHis departure was not part of a wider cull at the Saint Helier, Jersey-based company, which is currently recruiting for a number of positions, said one of the people who spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is private.\n\nSpiteri did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. CoinShares declined to comment.\n\nSpiteri has over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry and worked for CoinShares for over five years in London. Prior to CoinShares, he was employed as head of European distribution and capital markets at ETF issuer WisdomTree, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nIn February, Stockholm-listed CoinShares reported one of its strongest quarters to date. Fourth-quarter revenue rose to £48.3 million versus £31.6 million a year earlier.",
