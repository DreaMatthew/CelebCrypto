    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\ntraded around its 200-day average of $84,000 as the notorious Hyperliquid whale exited its multimillion dollar short BTC position. Smaller coins like CAKE, TKX, OKB and ATOM contributed to market optimism with positive performances.\n\nThe SUI token struggled to extend Monday's 6% surge, which was spurred by asset managers' ETF filings with the SEC, showcasing growing institutional interest in the wider crypto market.\n\nWhile some analysts declared the end of the bitcoin bull run, casting doubt about the sustainability of the recent bounce, data indicated otherwise, pointing to exhaustion in the ETF-led selling pressure.\n\nOn Monday, U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs attracted $275 million in investor funds, building on Friday's $41 million influx. That's the first back-to-back inflows since Feb. 7, according to data tracked by Farside Investors.\n\n\"This data reinforces the narrative that ETF-driven selling pressure is exhausting,\" said Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN. \"If this trend continues, we could see inflows gradually build momentum, further supporting bitcoin’s price.\"\n\nThe Fed's rate decision on Wednesday could introduce volatility into the crypto market with a dovish statement possibly spurring increased risk-taking.\n\n\"Post-FOMC, bitcoin is expected to trade within the range of $80,000 to $86,000 with 80% confidence, while ethereum is projected to fluctuate between $1,800 and $2,100 under the same confidence level,\" according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. \"These ranges reflect potential movements tied to macroeconomic signals, investor sentiment, and broader financial conditions.\"\n\nIn traditional markets, European stocks edged higher before a German parliamentary vote on historic debt reforms. Gold remained firm above $3,000 per ounce, with BlackRock calling the yellow metal a better diversifier than Treasury notes in the ongoing macro environment.\n\nMeanwhile, futures tied to the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow traded unchanged to negative amid reports that the Trump-Putin call regarding the Ukraine peace deal would take place between 13:00 and 15:00 GMT.
