He also worked under Senator Thom Tillis in the U.S. Senate and under Congressmen Robert Hurt and John Boehner in the House of Representatives.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this month charging the Treasury and Commerce Departments with creating a sovereign wealth fund which he expects to be created before the end of this year.\n\nWhile bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,880.85\nhas not been mentioned in relation to the fund, it could potentially be a vehicle through which the government might buy and hold the crypto.\n\nTrump has previously proposed that the federal government hold digital currencies as part of its national reserve strategy. However, in an executive order, he only charged his crypto advisers with evaluating the creation of a digital asset reserve.",
