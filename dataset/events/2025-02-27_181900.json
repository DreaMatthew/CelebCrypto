For instance, major exchanges Kraken and Coinbase are said to be vying for ownership of the leading crypto options exchange Deribit. Meanwhile, FalconX also bought Arbelos Markets earlier this year to expand its derivatives business.\n\nBack in 2020, BitMEX was alleged to have failed to implement adequate anti-money laundering measures in place, and later pled guilty to the charges.
