    "summary": "MSTR's recent price action is exact inverse of the BTC topping pattern from January that warned of a price sell-off.",
    "content": "A bullish technical analysis pattern, contrasting with the one in bitcoin (BTC) that warned of a recent market swoon, is seemingly emerging on bitcoin-holder MicroStrategy's (MSTR) price chart.\n\nThe MicroStrategy pattern, a double bottom, comprises two consecutive troughs at about the same price, said to reflect downtrend exhaustion, and a trendline (a so-called neckline) drawn through the high point between them. A move beyond the trendline confirms the breakout, or the bearish-to-bullish trend change.\n\nThat's especially true when the pattern unfolds after a notable slide, as in MSTR's case, and the gap between troughs and the high is at least 10%, according to technical analysis theory. In MSTR's case, it's greater than 35%.\n\nThe chart shows a double bottom in MSTR at around $230 since late February with the neckline resistance identified by the early March recovery to $320.94.\n\nA price move through that resistance would confirm the double-bottom breakout and signal a renewed bull run. Technical analysts typically add the gap between troughs and the neckline to the breakout point to derive the potential upside move, which, in this case, means a rally to $410.\n\nThe share price has also broken through the downtrend line, characterizing the meltdown from the November high of $543.\n\nThe evolving double bottom on the MSTR price chart looks like a mirror image of BTC's double top. That pattern from early this year that warned of a price sell-off to $75,000.\n\nBTC's double top breakdown happened on Feb. 24, with prices falling below $91,000, suggesting a bearish trend reversal. The decline gathered pace in the following days, with prices sliding to as low as $76,800 last week. Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, saw a similar breakdown early this month.\n\nDouble bottoms and double tops both have low failure rates, according to CMT books, meaning breakouts and breakdowns usually lead to extended price rallies or sell-offs.\n\nMicroStrategy is the world's largest publicly listed bitcoin holder, boasting a coin stash of 499,096 BTC ($41.5 billion).",
