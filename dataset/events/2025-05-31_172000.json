    "content": "James Wynn, the trader whose risky moves on Hyperliquid captivated crypto watchers this month, has been fully liquidated.\n\nHe ended a volatile month with just $23 left in his account, according to HyperDash data.\n\nWynn built his reputation and following by placing massive, leveraged on-chain trades across bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,658.25\n, PEPE\nPEPE\n$0.0₅5682\n, and other tokens.\n\nHis downfall began with a $1.25 billion long position on BTC that unraveled as prices dropped below $105,000 amid growing geopolitical uncertainty. That trade alone cost him more than $37 million after fees.\n\nThe trader briefly pivoted to memecoins like PEPE, where one long position initially gained over 10%, before market swings liquidated him again.\n\nOver the course of the month, Wynn cycled through assets including ETH, SUI, TRUMP, and even FARTCOIN. His trades at one point saw him achieve an unrealized gain of $85 million.\n\nAn account associated with Wynn on X commented on the liquidation and dismissed the losses. “I’ll run it back, I always do. And I’ll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game,” the account wrote on X. “I took a large and calculated bet at making billions.”",
