    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,998.62\nis likely headed for a period of heightened volatility as 170,000 BTC — worth over $14 billion at its current price of $84,500 — have moved from wallets held for three to six months, a cohort often linked to market turning points, CryptoQuant warned in a post.\n\nOn-chain behavior from this group has historically served as an early signal for major price action, according to the post. Mid-term holders are typically considered to be traders that hold a cryptocurrency for anywhere between three to 12 months.\n\nThey tend to be more reactive to market conditions than long-term holders but less impulsive than short-term traders, making their movements especially telling during transitional periods.\n\nWhen large amounts of bitcoin shift out of this cohort, it can indicate growing uncertainty or strategic positioning ahead of an anticipated market event. In either case, analysts view this as a sign that a sharp move is coming, though the direction remains unclear.\n\nA similar pattern emerged ahead of previous surges and corrections, including during 2021’s bull run and 2022’s capitulation.\n\nBitcoin has been trading between $75,000 and $87,000 over the past months as tensions between the U.S. and other countries as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have caused anxiety in markets.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
