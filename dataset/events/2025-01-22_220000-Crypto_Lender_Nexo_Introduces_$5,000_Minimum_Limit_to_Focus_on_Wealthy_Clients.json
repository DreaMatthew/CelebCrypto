    "content": "Crypto trading and lending platform Nexo is set to introduce a $5,000 minimum limit to use its services as the firm evolves into a digital assets wealth manager targeting the mass affluent market.\n\nThe move, which comes into effect in February, is part of the firm’s 2025 growth strategy and recent rebranding, according to a press release on Tuesday.\n\n“Guided by principles rooted in traditional finance and the personalized excellence of private white-glove services, we are committed to delivering sustainable wealth solutions for generations to come,” Nexo co-founder Kosta Kantchev said in a statement.\n\nNexo is one of the few crypto borrow and lend platforms to have survived the bear market of 2022-23, and collapse of many centralized crypto finance firms at that time. Looking ahead, Nexo won an initial approval to operate as a licensed entity in Dubai in March of last year.\n\nNexo has over $11 billion in assets under management, has issued $8 billion in crypto credit, and paid out over $1 billion in interest, the company said.\n\n[Update: date in story changed to February]",
