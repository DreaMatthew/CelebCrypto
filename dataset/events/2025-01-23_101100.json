    "summary": "The largest cryptocurrency seems to be tracking the 2017 price performance, when it posted all-time highs on 77 days.",
    "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is likely to hit record highs on more than 70 days this year, more than triple last year's number, if the price continues to mirror 2017's performance.\n\nIt's already on the way, hitting $109,000 on Jan. 20, the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration. In 2024, it made 23 records, the most since 2017, when it touched all-time highs on 77 days. This year, the price action seems to be tracking the trajectory of eight years ago.\n\nRecord highs seem to elicit different reactions in crypto and traditional financial markets. Typically, when bitcoin breaks to a new high, the market is deemed overheated, greedy and overpriced. Assets such as gold and equities, however, often extend their bull runs. Gold made new all-time highs at least 33 times in 2024.",
