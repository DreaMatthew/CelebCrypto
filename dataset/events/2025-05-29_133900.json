In that scenario, they would be entitled to redeem at 80% of the initial public offering price.\n\nThe tender offer closed May 28, with settlement expected on June 5. CoinDesk previously reported the round drew interest from from both returning investors such as the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, as well as new entrants including hedge fund Citadel\n\nThe notes carry a 9% coupon, two percentage points above Telegram's previous $2.35 billion bond issued in 2021.\n\nTelegram passed $1 billion in revenue last year and holds over $500 million in cash reserves, excluding crypto, Bloomberg’s report adds.",
