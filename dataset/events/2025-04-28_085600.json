    "content": "On-chain researcher ZachXBT may have determined why privacy coin Monero (XMR) surged as much as 40% early Monday: Someone probably got hacked.\n\nZachXBT reported that 3,520 bitcoin (BTC) ($330.7 million) was drained from an address and then swapped for XMR.\n\nMarket data shows a spike in volatility coming from an excess in buy orders for the XMR-BTC order book.\n\nMarket observers initially had a hard time determining what caused the major spike as metrics such as active wallets and network activity hadn't risen accordingly.\n\nRead More: Monero’s XMR Rockets 40% as XRP Leads Crypto Majors Gains\n\nLiquidity for XMR has been limited during the past few months as major exchanges delisted the privacy token in a bid to fight dark net markets. The lack of liquidity would have made any sizeable buy a catalyst for outsized pricing gains. CoinGecko data shows that the order depth for XMR is significantly smaller than for tokens of similar market cap.\n\nXMR is trading for over $300 according to CoinDesk markets data.",
