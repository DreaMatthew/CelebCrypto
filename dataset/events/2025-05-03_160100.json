After passing the state House in a narrow 31–25 vote, the bill reached Hobbs' desk, where it was swiftly struck down.\n\n“The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans' retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу,” Hobbs wrote in a statement.\n\nThe veto ends a push that could have made Arizona the first state to set up a cryptocurrency reserve, and it could have even outpaced the U.S. Treasury Department in doing so.\n\nRead more: As One State Gets Closer on a Crypto Reserve, Others Jump Into the Fray",
