    "content": "Crypto fund behemoth Grayscale Investments has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its XRP Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), which will listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\nThe existing product operates as a Delaware statutory trust, managing over $16 million XRP as of Friday. The proposed ETF would continue to hold XRP as its primary asset and track its performance on a price return basis, adjusted for operational fees, providing investors with a direct link to XRP's performance.\n\nBesides Grayscale, firms like CoinShares and Bitwise have also submitted applications for XRP-based ETFs, indicating a growing institutional appetite for structured investment products in XRP.\n\nEarlier in January, Ripple Labs president Monica Long remarked an XRP ETF could “soon be a reality” under the new Trump administration, one that has promised to bring crypto innovation back to the U.S. and support locally-based businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, trading volumes on XRP-native applications have been on the rise as it gains favor among investors. Swap volumes on XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) crossed the $400 million mark in January to cross the $1 billion mark for the first time since its automated market maker feature launched in May — a feat that some say contributed to making 2024 a “monumental” year for the token.",
