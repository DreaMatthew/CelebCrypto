    "content": "The cryptocurrency market continues to reflect broader economic uncertainties as\nSHIB\n$0.0₅9090\nfaces significant downward pressure.\n\nRecent price action shows SHIB testing critical support at $0.0000127 after experiencing a 7.4% decline from recent highs, with volume spikes coinciding with major selloffs particularly during early May, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.\n\nDespite current volatility, on-chain data reveals growing institutional confidence in SHIB's long-term prospects. April 2025 saw the addition of 109 new millionaire wallets holding SHIB, bringing the total to 860 addresses with at least $1 million in tokens. This accumulation occurred even as SHIB's 7% price gain in April underperformed compared to Bitcoin's surge toward $95,000.\n\nMarket sentiment remains cautiously optimistic as futures open interest for SHIB nearly doubled in April, rising from under $97 million to nearly $190 million. Meanwhile, ongoing development of Shibarium, SHIB's Layer-2 blockchain, continues with improvements to transaction throughput and validator onboarding that could provide fundamental support for future price action.\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights\n\nDisclaimer: This article was generated with AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
