    "summary": "The company has hit a BTC yield of 68% so far in 2025.",
    "content": "Tokyo-based investment firm Metaplanet said Monday it had acquired an additional 150 bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,412.24\nto bring its total holdings to 3,350 BTC, valued at approximately $291 million at current market rates.\n\nThe purchase comes just days after the company made Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, to its newly formed strategic advisory board. He is expected to bring a high-profile perspective to Metaplanet’s ambitions.\n\nMetaplanet is working to boost its value for shareholders by buying and holding bitcoin, using a measure called BTC Yield to track how well this plan is working.\n\nBTC Yield shows the percentage change in the amount of Bitcoin they own compared to the total number of shares, over a set time. From July to September 2024, their BTC Yield was 41.7%, meaning their bitcoin stash grew steadily compared to shares. Then, from October to December 2024, it jumped to 309.8% because they bought a lot more bitcoin while its price soared.\n\nSo far in 2025, from Jan. 1 to March 24, they’ve hit a BTC Yield of 68.3%, per Monday’s documents.\nIn an X post, Dylan LeClair, Head of Bitcoin Strategy at Metaplanet, noted that the company ended the day as the 13th most liquid stock in Japan, recording a daily trading volume of $336.6 million—surpassing both Toyota and Nintendo. The stock closed up 7% on the day, finishing above 5,000 yen.",
