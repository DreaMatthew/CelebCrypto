The exchange did not say which firm it acquired.\n\nWith its MiFID II license, OKX will be able to provide regulated derivatives products and services to its institutional clients in the European Economic Area, which includes 27 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nThis is another step solidifying the third-largest exchange in terms of market cap in the EU, the release said. It attained a Markets in Crypto Assets license from Malta in January.\n\nRead more: One Trading Secures Regulatory Approval From Dutch Regulator to Offer Crypto Derivatives Trading in Europe",
