Other crypto firms now considering U.S. expansion or shares sales to the public include Blockchain.com, Circle, Kraken, Gemini Ripple and BitGo. Bullish Global, the parent of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO.\n\nThe New York office is set to open later this year, with an initial team of between five and 10 employees. Gaevoy said Wintermute won’t be conducting trading activities out of the new office.",
