    "content": "Ethereum activated its long-awaited “Pectra” upgrade on Wednesday, marking the blockchain’s most significant overhaul since the Merge in 2022.\n\nThe update aims to streamline staking, enhance wallet functionality, and improve overall efficiency. It arrives as Ethereum contends with rising competition and internal debates over its direction.\n\nThe Pectra upgrade, a \"hard fork\" in blockchain parlance, was triggered at 10:05 UTC and finalized around 13 minutes later.\n\nA key element of the upgrade involves increasing the amount of ETH one can stake from 32 to 2,048. This change could help speed up and streamline operations for stakers, the vast network of companies and individuals who help keep the Ethereum network afloat.\n\nPreviously, staking at scale required setting up multiple validators; now, stakers can consolidate up to that amount under a single node.\n\nThe upgrade, considered to be Ethereum's biggest since the 2022 Merge to proof-of-stake, comes at a delicate moment for the ecosystem. It follows two failed test runs, one of which put a key Ethereum test network permanently out of commission.\n\nAdditionally, Ethereum, the network that introduced smart contracts and blockchain-based decentralized applications, has steadily lost market share to more nimble competitors in recent months.\n\nSolana, in particular, has attracted more new developers over the last year than Ethereum, which was long considered the dominant non-Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum community has debated whether its unofficial leader — the non-profit Ethereum Foundation — is to blame for the lagging price of the ETH token, and the perception within the industry that the network lacks a cohesive vision.\n\nIn response, the Swiss foundation introduced new leadership and a fresh set of plans to reinvigorate the chain's developer community.\n\nCentral to the upgrade is EIP-7251, which increases the maximum amount validators can stake from 32 to 2,048 ETH.\n\nThe change is intended to assist staking institutions and infrastructure providers by addressing the needs of validators who stake ETH to keep the chain operational. If you want to invest more than 32 ETH with the network, you must divide your stake among dozens—or sometimes, hundreds—of separate nodes.\n\nThis not only consumes time and incurs costs, but it has also resulted in weeks-long lines for new nodes to join the network.\n\nBy upping the staking limit, \"This means that small operators can compound their stake directly, while large ones can consolidate validators to reduce bandwidth use on the p2p network,” wrote Tim Beiko, the protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, over X.\n\nAnother core component of the hard fork, EIP-7702, would allow crypto wallets to temporarily function as smart contracts. This change brings the Ethereum network closer to account abstraction, a series of features that pave the way for more user-friendly crypto wallets.\n\nUsers could, for instance, pay transaction fees in stablecoins instead of ETH, set up an automatic payments system, or introduce recovery access to wallets if they forget their seed phrases.\n\nWhile EIP-7251 and EIP-7702 are the main focuses of Pectra, nine other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) have made it into the package, mostly affecting staking providers, validators, and developers:\n\nRead more: Ethereum Preps for Biggest Code Change Since the Merge With Pectra Upgrade\n\nUPDATE (10:22 UTC): Updates to state that Pectra upgrade has finalized.",
