    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\ncontinues to climb the wall of worry, pushing above $97,000 despite hotter-than-expected U.S. consumer and producer price inflation reports in the past couple of days. That's a surprise. With prices rising and the likelihood of a Fed rate cut receding, you'd expect risky investments like cryptocurrencies to pause, at the very least.\n\nThe buoyant behavior is possibly underpinned by signs that inflation is still seen as easing in coming months.\n\n\"Bitcoin could likely get some relief in the short-term judging by the high-frequency U.S. inflation indicator by truflation which suggests a significant decline in headline inflation over the coming months,\" said Andre Dragosch, the head of European research at Bitwise. The Truflation U.S. Inflation Index currently shows 2.06%, indicating a potential decline.\n\nDragosch also noted the Federal Reserve's cautious stance, suggesting the central bank is very aware of what happened in the 1970s, when three waves of inflation hit peaks of 6.2%, 12% and 15%.\n\n\"The Fed is afraid of the 1970s inflation scenario, which is why it rather takes a more cautious approach at the moment and is afraid of cutting rates too aggressively,\" he said.\n\nAll that means the bitcoin bull market is far from over if historical trends hold out. Take a look at the 200-week moving average (a period of almost four years!). That's currently around $44,200, below the previous market peak of $69,000 from November 2021. In the past, the average has risen toward the prior record, a move that implies further price growth is on the cards.\n\nAlso consider that short-term holders have accumulated 1.5 million bitcoin since September, showing continued demand from investors who tend to keep their BTC for less than 155 days.\n\nOn the public company front, Coinbase followed Robinhood with strong earnings and Gamestop is pondering a bitcoin investment, another potential catalyst for the market. Stay Alert!\n\nCoinDesk's Consensus to take place in Hong Kong on Feb. 18-20 and in Toronto on May 14-16. Use code DAYBOOK and save 15% on passes.\n\nBy Francisco Rodrigues\n\nBinance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao’s dog has been the talk of the town. After revealing he had the pet and being bombarded with requests for information, he eventually gave in, knowing memecoins would be launched.\n\nZhao shared a picture of himself with the Belgian malinois named Broccoli in a lengthy post that inspired a slew memecoins. These tokens, trading under the ticker BROCCOLI, debuted both BNB Chain and Solana.\n\nSome saw significant price rises right after their introduction to reach billion dollar-plus market caps as traders rushed in. As the hype faded, so did the prices. Fortunes were made and sold over Broccoli.\n\nOne trader, for example, spent less than $1,000 to create a token inspired by the dog and started selling the tokens just two minutes later. The trader managed to make $6.5 million on the launch, as CoinDesk's Danny Nelson reported.\n\nThe volatility affected the price of BNB itself, which is now 6.6% lower in the last 24 hours while bitcoin and ether are both up slightly. PancakeSwap’s CAKE token, which was up more than 70% on the week, is down 18%in the same period.\n\nElsewhere, the Trump-backed DeFi protocol WLFI has kept accumulating tokens, purchasing around $5 million worth of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and $1.4 million of\nMOVE\n$0.06319\n.\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
