    "content": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto business tied to President Donald Trump and his family, is pushing back against scrutiny from U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, the leading Democrat on a panel responsible for investigating corruption and mismanagement.\n\n\"WLFI is not operating in the shadows,\" according to a letter the company's lawyers sent to the Connecticut senator. \"It is building a next-generation, auditable financial infrastructure rooted in American trust, rule of law and economic leadership.\"\n\nBlumenthal had targeted his own letter at co-founder Zach Witkoff — set to appear alongside fellow co-founder Zak Folkman and Eric Trump at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on Friday — and asked about the ownership and investment structure for Trump-affiliated entities, including WLFI and Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company behind the TRUMP memecoin. Since he's not in the majority party, Blumenthal's probe doesn't carry the full force of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, a panel housed within the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.\n\nThe WLFI response said Blumenthal's request \"contains inaccuracies and fundamental flawed inferences that we will not address in full,\" but the lawyers offered the example that WLFI has no affiliation with Fight, Fight, Fight LLC.\n\n\"The company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,\" the letter said. \"What it opposes is the misuse of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.\"\n\nThe president's son, Eric, who is listed as a Web3 ambassador on the WLFI website alongside his father, the \"chief crypto advocate,\" also appeared at Consensus 2025 on Thursday to explain how he entered crypto and why he launched a mining firm set to go public via a merger.\n\n\"We have come to love the crypto community, and I think the crypto community has really come to love us,\" he told a crowded house in Toronto. \"We're so proud to be a big part of it.\"\n\nThe Trump family's crypto ties have also been raised by Senate Democrats objecting to digital assets legislation working its way through Congress. Even so, a stablecoin regulation bill is expected to come up for a key vote next week.\n\nRead More: Eric Trump Says He Got Into Crypto Amid Political Attack, Calls Bitcoin 'Digital Gold'",
