Hashdex's Crypto Index ETF gives investors exposure to a basket of different cryptocurrencies, while Franklin Templeton said it would launch its product sometime in January.\n\nBitwise's product, launched with the New York Stock Exchange, gives investors exposure to both spot bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,842.06\nand ethereum\nETH\n$3,496.22\n, weighted by market capitalization. NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC last November.\n\nAsset management firms have filed a flurry of crypto-related ETF applications in recent days, seeking to take advantage of new U.S. President Donald Trump's administration's promised lighter touch on regulatory issues.\n\nCompanies have filed for ETFs tracking the price of memecoins like\nDOGE\n$0.1648\nand cryptocurrencies like Solana\nSOL\n$159.89\n.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Coinbase also filed to list and trade futures products tracking Solana and Hedera.\n\nUPDATE (Jan. 31, 2025, 01:21 UTC): Adds additional detail.",
