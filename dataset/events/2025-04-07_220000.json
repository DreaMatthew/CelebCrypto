The firm is expected to list shortly afterward. CEO Mike Novogratz called the registration effectiveness “an important milestone” in the firm’s bid to expand its reach.\n\nGalaxy provides institutional services in crypto trading, asset management, and tokenization. It also invests in and operates data centers that power AI and high-performance computing.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
