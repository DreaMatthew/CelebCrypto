    "content": "Galaxy Digital (GLXY) said it deepened its strategic partnership with CoreWeave (CRWV), reinforcing its ambitions in the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) data center industry.\n\nUnder a new agreement, CoreWeave will gain access to an additional 260 megawatts (MW) of critical IT load at Galaxy’s Helios data center campus in West Texas, bringing the total committed capacity for AI and HPC operations at the site to 393 MW.\n\nThe move marks another shift by Galaxy away from bitcoin mining, with the Helios campus acquired from Argo Blockchain in 2022 moving toward becoming a cornerstone for next-gen digital infrastructure. CEO Mike Novogratz emphasized the strategic value of diversifying the company's business across blockchain, crypto and AI, highlighting the long-term potential to maximize shareholder value.\n\nGalaxy shares rose as much as 8% in Toronto trading and are now up 60% from their April lows. CoreWeave rose as much as 13% as was recently trading 10% higher.\n\nThis announcement follows the March Phase I lease agreement that covered 133 MW over 15 years. The new Phase II commitment mirrors the terms of the initial deal and reflects both parties' confidence in the site's capacity and strategic location. With infrastructure upgrades already in motion, Phase I is expected to be service-ready by mid-2026, while Phase II will come online in 2027.\n\nThe site benefits from 800 MW of approved capacity and an additional 1.7 gigawatts currently undergoing evaluation — positioning Galaxy for further expansion.\n\nCoreWeave retains exclusivity for even more capacity\n\nMeanwhile, Galaxy is also exploring opportunities to monetize its legacy bitcoin mining infrastructure, signaling a decisive pivot in its operational focus.\n\nDisclaimer: This article, or parts of it, was generated with assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
