    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin held above $100,000, with VET, ENA, LINK and LDO posting notable gains a day after President Donald Trump bypassed mentioning crypto or a strategic bitcoin reserve in his inauguration speech.\n\nSignals from the bitcoin options market indicate heightened expectations for short-term price turbulence alongside signs of growing risk aversion among traders since Trump's swearing in, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin.\n\nThat could be due to several reasons, including MicroStrategy's impending shareholder vote today on expanding its authorized shares to support its bitcoin buying strategy. In addition, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is expected to increase rates on Friday, which may strengthen the yen. The late July BOJ rate hike torched the currency's rally, destabilizing risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere's also uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on Canada and Mexico and the looming debt ceiling although, historically, the latter has not had a significant bearish impact on risk assets.\n\n\"Markets received a stark reminder of life under President Trump, with more volatility-inducing rhetoric,\" QCP Capital said,.\n\nStill, observers remain optimistic.\n\n“Despite a generally disappointing first day for cryptocurrencies under the new administration, Bitcoin managed to remain firmly above $101K, sidestepping the feared ‘sell-the-news’ effect,” Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, noted. Fournier added that while regulatory progress and adjustments to national reserves may take time, conditions are expected to improve in the coming weeks.\n\nThe debut of the TRUMP memecoin over the weekend marked \"a fundamental shift in the American digital asset landscape, ultimately attracting new buyers, particularly into BTC and SOL,\" according to Laurent Benayoun, CEO of Acheron Trading.\n\n\"This phenomenon can be seen as a dual narrative: a significant value creation in TRUMP, initially driven by intra-market rotation, which later sparked fresh capital inflows as fundamental investors recognized the broader positive catalysts for digital assets,\" Benayoun said. Stay alert!\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nDonald and Melania Trump’s official memecoins have inspired wannabe token creators to issue tokens based on other family members. One such token themed after son Barron Trump just rug pulled for millions of dollars.\n\nA spoof X account impersonating Barron promoted a BARRON token, which quickly gained traction reaching a peak market cap of $87 million.\n\nInitially, a significant amount of liquidity was added to make the token appear legitimate and encourage trading. However, it seems the token was designed to deceive from the start. Once the token reached a high buy volume, all liquidity was removed from the token pools causing the price to crash.\n\nOn-chain watchers estimated at least $1 million worth of Solana’s SOL tokens were extracted in the rug pull, based on initial buying and final selling transactions.\n\nEven some industry observers were take in.\n\nU.S. exchanges were closed on Jan. 20 in observance of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.\n\nThe ETF data below is from Jan. 17 and remains unchanged.\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
