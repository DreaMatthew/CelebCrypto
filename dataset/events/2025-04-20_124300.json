    "content": "The price action for XRP and bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,998.62\nresembles a tightly compressed spring on the verge of uncoiling with a sudden release of energy.\n\nThat's the message from a key volatility indicator called Bollinger Bandwidth. Bollinger Bands are volatility bands set at plus two and minus two standard deviations above and below the 20-period moving average (SMA) of an asset's market price. The bandwidth measures the space between these bands as a percentage of the 20-day moving average.\n\nIn the case of XRP, the Bollinger bandwidth has narrowed to its lowest level since October 2024 on the 4-hour chart, where each candle represents price action for a four-hour period. The 4-hour chart interval is quite popular in the 24/7 crypto market, allowing traders to analyze and predict short-term price movements. Bitcoin's 4-hour chart mirrors the Bollinger band width pattern in XRP.\n\nThe long-held belief is that a tighter Bollinger band width, reflecting a quiet period in the market, is akin to a compressed spring ready for significant movement.\n\nDuring these calm phases, the market accumulates energy that is eventually released once a clear direction is established, often leading to dramatic rallies or sharp price declines. Both XRP and bitcoin surged in November-December following an extended range-bound period that left their bandwidth at levels comparable to those observed today.\n\nThat said, tighter bands do not always indicate a bullish volatility explosion; they can also foreshadow a sell-off. For example, the bands tightened in October 2022, signaling a significant move ahead, which materialized on the downside after FTX went bust.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this latest spring compression will trigger bullish volatility or lead both tokens into a tailspin. The recent hawkish comments from Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell and selling by some whales favor the latter.\n\nStay alert!",
