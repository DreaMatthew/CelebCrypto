    "summary": "The investment occurred as Ondo announced the introduction of its own blockchain for tokenized assets.",
    "content": "A wallet identified as belonging to World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform backed by President Donald Trump and his family, has deepened its investment in Ondo Finance, the second-largest issuer of tokenized Treasuries.\n\nThe address scooped up about 342,000 ONDO, the platform's governance token, for $470,000 USDC on the CoW Protocol, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. It first bought ONDO two months ago, worth $245,000 at the time, before sending the tokens to Coinbase Prime earlier this week.\n\nThe transaction happened as Ondo today announced that it will introduce its own layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized assets.\n\nONDO is trading at $1.298, down 3.7% in the last 24 hours amid a wider market downturn that has seen the CoinDesk 20 Index drop 3.1%.\n\nAlong with ONDO, the Trump family-backed DeFi project has also been accumulating TRX and wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).",
