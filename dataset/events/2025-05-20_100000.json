    "content": "TokenFi, a sister project to Floki that focuses on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, is set to tokenize the Floki Minibot M1 — an AI-powered robot built by Rice Robotics — marking what the team says is the first tokenization of a consumer AI robot.\n\nThe move coincides with the launch of TokenFi’s RWA tokenization module on May 23. A presale for the Minibot M1's token will go live the same day, initially for users on a whitelist compiled by Rice AI and select Floki ecosystem participants.\n\nThe presale ties into broader plans to launch Rice AI's RICE token and conduct an airdrop for\nFLOKI\n$0.0₄5880\nand\nTOKEN\n$0.006413\nholders, according to the announcement. Further details are expected post-sale, the team told CoinDesk.\n\nThe Floki Minibot is a branded version of Rice Robotics’ compact delivery and companion robot, which operates autonomously and is built on the RICE AI system. Rice Robotics counts Nvidia, Softbank, Mitsui Fudosan and 7-Eleven Japan among its partners and clients.\n\n\"This is the first time in history that an AI robot will be tokenized,” TokenFi said in a statement to CoinDesk. “It’s a phenomenal moment for TokenFi, the RWA industry, and the AI robotics space.”\n\nTokenFi aims to be a leading RWA infrastructure provider, allowing companies to tokenize real-world items — from assets to equity and now robotics — using blockchain rails.\n\nFloki developers said earlier this year that they believe Rice Robotics is “well-positioned for growth” in the AI robotics sector, citing industry projections that peg the market at over $100 billion by 2030.\n\nTOKEN has gained 19% in the past 24 hours, data from CoinGecko show, alongside a jump in major tokens. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, has added 3%.",
