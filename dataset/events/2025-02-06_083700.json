    "summary": "Burwick Law proposed a class action lawsuit in January alleging Pump.Fun was engaged in violating securities laws",
    "content": "Two law firms that are involved in a proposed a class action suit against Pump.fun say they are now victims of tokens that are impersonating the firm's likeness, and are demanding in a cease and desist letter that the memecoin factory immediately remove them.\n\nAt the center of the controversy is a token called 'DOGSHIT2' a Solana-based memecoin that's up almost 200%, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nIt might be confusing to those not terminally online why a law firm would claim a canine excrement-themed token would violate its intellectual property, but references to the token being tied to one of the firm's wallets were found in exhibits initially filed by Burwick against Pump.fun which sought to demonstrate how easy it was to launch tokens on the platform.\n\n\"Our firms have no affiliation, endorsement, or ownership interest in the Dogshit2 token or any related assets,\" Burwick Law wrote in a post on X. \"Simply put, our firms have not launched any memecoins onchain.\"\n\nBurwick Law also wrote on X that PumpFun launched tokens that it claims were designed to \"intimidate our clients and interfere with ongoing litigation.\"\n\n\"These efforts include the creation of memecoins that impersonate our plaintiffs. These acts represent the use of blockchain technologies as a tool for disrupting justice and due process,\" Burwick Law wrote.\n\nBurwick Law previously represented investors in a lawsuit against the creators of Hawk Tuah ($HAWK), alleging they exploited Hailey Welch’s internet fame to promote an unregistered security.",
