    "summary": "DTTM Operations filed a trademark application that hints at software that manages crypto, NFTs and virtual reality services.",
    "content": "DTTM Operations, a company that manages U.S. President Donald Trump's IP rights, filed a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) which might hint at potential non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and metaverse platform.\n\nThe document lists various products related to blockchain-based goods and services, including accessing NFTs, managing cryptocurrency transactions, virtual reality software and hardware and game software featuring crypto tokens for use in online virtual worlds. The filing status says the application has been accepted by the office and is awaiting an examiner.\n\nMetaverse, which became a hype during the 2021 bull run and was embraced and later dropped by many big-name brands, including bit-tech and celebrities, refers to a virtual reality world where humans can interact with each other in a digital world that's beyond their physical and geographical barriers.\n\nRead more: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Metaverse (but Were Afraid to Ask)\n\nWhile the nature of the filing doesn't directly say what the platform is or when it will launch, it does mention the inclusion of various collectibles of Trump. \"Computer services, namely, creating an on-line virtual environment for exchange of digital collectibles featuring images, sound, videos and texts of Donald J Trump,\" the filing said.\n\nTrump has ushered in a friendlier crypto administration, which saw the President launching his own TRUMP memecoin and a promise of making bitcoin the reserve currency of the U.S. He has also launched his own NFTs, some of which, aside from being collectibles, allowed few owners to access to Trump sneakers, Trump cocktails and dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, with Trump.\n\nRead more: Trump Releases Fourth Drop of His NFT Trading Cards\n\nThis move, if it comes to fruition, could breathe some life into metaverse-related tokens such as Sandbox (SAND) and\nMANA\n$0.2157\n, which had been hurting as metaverse demand has mostly evaporated since the 2021 hype. However, it will all depend on how Trump's firm decides to launch this platform or if it gets rolled out at all since filing a trademark doesn't always mean a product will launch.",
