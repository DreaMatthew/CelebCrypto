    "content": "Binance Futures listed HYPE, the native token of rival derivatives exchange HyperLiquid, on Friday.\n\nHYPE rose by 77.5% over the past 30 days as it made its way into the 15 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nThe Binance listing is a USD-margined perpetual contact that offers up to 75x leverage.\n\nProminent trader and HyperLiquid supporter Flood said on X that the first exchange that lists HYPE spot markets will make \"$100 million in fees\" in the first year.\n\nHYPE was unmoved by the announcement; it is down by 4.3% over the past 24 hours in line with a wider crypto market slump.\n\nHyperLiquid notched $11 billion in perpetual trading volume during the same period as it rapidly emerges as this cycle's decentralized derivatives exchange of choice.\n\nBinance futures, meanwhile, remains the largest centralized exchange with $91 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.",
