    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,884.12\nand other digital assets have dropped as part of a wider macro-driven sell-off in the market and there is a risk that forced selling could lead to further weakness, investment bank Standard Chartered said in a report on Monday.\n\nThe market downturn was triggered by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish press conference in mid-December.\n\nThe bank noted that investors who took on bitcoin exposure after the U.S. election in November, are now \"only breaking even,\" and there is a risk that forced or panic selling could add to the sell-off. This includes exchange-traded fund (ETF) buyers and BTC acquirer MicroStrategy (MSTR).\n\n\"The risk of mark-to-market pain is building,\" wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.\n\nIf the world's largest cryptocurrency breaks below the key $90,000 level, it could retrace 10% lower to the low $80,000s the report said, and other digital assets would also likely fall.\n\nThe bank advises adding bitcoin once the retracement is over.\n\nStandard Chartered still expects bitcoin to hit $200,000 by the end of the year, fueled by the resumption of institutional inflows under the new Trump administration.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Sees BTC Reaching as High as $250K by Year-End",
