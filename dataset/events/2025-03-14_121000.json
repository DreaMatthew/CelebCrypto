In line with many other ecosystems, ZKsync has decided to be more conservative with spend in the short to medium term in response to these evolving conditions,\" it added. \"To stay sustainable, we’re tightening our focus and spending smarter, rather than fighting headwinds.\"\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) on ZKsync is down by around 50% since Jan. 30 as the wider crypto market is grappling with a correction that has seen bitcoin and ether lose 13% and 27% of their respective market caps in the past month.\n\nZKsync's native token (ZK) has plunged by 35% in the same period.",
