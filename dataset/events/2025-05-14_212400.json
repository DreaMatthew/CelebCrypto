    "content": "Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley denied reports that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is investigating the crypto bank, calling the reporting “bullshit” during a panel discussion at Consensus 2025 in Toronto on Wednesday\n\nIn an article published last month, business publication Barron’s reported that DHS’s money laundering and financial crimes unit, the El Dorado Task Force, was contacting former Anchorage employees to ask them about the company’s practices and policies. Neither Anchorage nor DHS commented on the record for that story.\n\nFollowing the report, McCauley said his firm asked its lawyers to look into the allegations and found them to be untrue.\n\n“There is no investigation into us, as is unambiguously clear at this point,” McCauley said. “That article is what some might call bullshit. Happy to clear the air on that.”\n\nAnchorage Digital is widely considered one of the most regulatory compliant companies in the crypto space. In December, it obtained a highly-coveted and difficult-to-get BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), one of the toughest regulators in the crypto industry.",
