The company behind the protocol is holding a summit in New York later this week with several traditional finance heavyweights including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton participating.\n\nThe native token of\nOM\n$0.09177\n, layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized assets focusing on the Middle East market, rebounded 30% from Monday's bottom and was up 16% on the day. The network last month announced a billion-dollar asset tokenization partnership with Dubai property conglomerate DAMAC Group encompassing real estate and data center investments.\n\nThe native token of\nCHEX\n$0.04389\n, a tokenization platform regulated and licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, advanced 27% during the same period. The protocol laid out plans late January to enter the U.S. market and pursue securities licensing in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,927.42\nrebounded above $101,000 from the overnight lows and was 4% higher in a 24-hour period. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index consisting of large-cap tokens lagged with a 2% gain.\n\nSophisticated investors often analyze the fastest horses recovering from capitulation lows to identify underlying strength in the broader market.

The RWA sector saw a 200% expansion to $7.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) last year, with government securities protocols leading the growth, crypto trading firm Wintermute noted.\n\nRecently, various influential leaders in the financial world touted tokenized RWAs as the next frontier of financial innovation with a potential to become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of asset management behemoth BlackRock, urged U.S. regulators and policymakers to create rules for tokenized securities, envisioning that bonds and stocks will be traded on blockchain rails in the future.\n\nHe was joined by Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev last week, who proposed rule changes to unlock tokenized private equities to retail investors, currently limited to accredited investors and wealthy individuals.\n\nUPDATE (Feb. 3, 21:10 UTC): Adds RWA sector expansion data from Wintermute.",
