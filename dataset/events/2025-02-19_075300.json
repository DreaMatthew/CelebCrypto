    "summary": "Trading volume for XRP is up by 26% to $5.5 billion in the past 24 hours.",
    "content": "U.S. president Donald Trump shared an XRP-related article on social media platform Truth Social on Tuesday, stoking excitement and speculation among the XRP community.\n\nThe article, published by CoinDesk in January, revealed how Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse experienced an uptick in U.S. deals and hiring efforts following Trump's election victory in November.\n\nThe post generated 6.3K likes and 268 replies, the majority of which uttered phrases like \"XRP to the moon\" and discussed how XRP should become the currency that underpins a potential U.S. crypto reserve.\n\nThe XRP token remained fairly muted at $2.53 after the post, although trading volume is up by 26% in 24 hours to $5.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe post comes as the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) put the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its crosshairs on Monday — which could end in a positive result for Ripple as it is facing an appeal from the regulator in relation to an alleged unregistered securities offering in 2020.\n\nThere is also an expectation that an XRP exchanged traded fund (ETF) will be approved this year after the SEC acknowledged a filing by the New York Stock Exchange and Grayscale last week.",
