    "content": "CANTO, the native token its namesake's layer-1 blockchain, experienced a volatile trading session on Thursday, rising by 250% before losing 60% of its value over the subsequent six hours.\n\nThe platform had lost the majority of its TVL (total value locked) and trading appetite after a feverish launch last year that saw it reach a $238 million market cap with $204 million in TVL.\n\nIt currently has just $4.6 million worth of assets locked on the chain as a network outage prompted an exodus from the chain.\n\nCanto's plight also occurred during a wave of new layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains that caused an over saturation in protocols and liquidity.\n\nThe project has not posted an update on X since September, despite stating that a new roadmap \"would be released soon.\"\n\nThursday's move can be attributed to a low liquidity low volume impulse in market buys, causing a momentary spike before a sell-off sparked by underwater positions taking profits.",
