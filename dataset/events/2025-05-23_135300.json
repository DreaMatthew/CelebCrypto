BTC longs accounted for $107 million of the total, while Ethereum's ether\nETH\n$3,331.23\nfollowed with close to $87 million. Other tokens, including Solana's SOL\nSOL\n$157.39\n, dogecoin\nDOGE\n$0.1651\n, and SUI\nSUI\n$2.0249\nsaw liquidations ranging between $10 million and $18 million.\n\n\"Nice aggregate flush of long leverage and de-risk selling from spot,\" well-followed crypto trader Skew noted in an X post early Friday. \"All driven by headlines once again.\"\n\nThe sell-off came after Trump proposed a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union starting next month, along with a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S., reigniting fears of an escalating trade war.\n\nAs a result, BTC and major altcoins such as Ether\nETH\n$3,331.23\n, XRP\nXRP\n$2.2497\n, and Cardano\nADA\n$0.5341\nfell 3% to 4%, while smaller-cap tokens like Uniswap\nUNI\n$5.1914\nand SUI\nSUI\n$2.0249\ndropped 5% to 7% over the past 24 hours.\n\nCrypto trader named James Wynn, who gained attention recently opening a $1.1 billion BTC long bet with 40x leverage on the Hyperliquid exchange, also slipped underwater on the massive position. Currently, the trader is sitting on $7.5 million of unrealized losses, and the position could be liquidated if BTC slips to $102,000, according to a screenshot shared on X.\n\nInterestingly, the long liquidations came amid a recent unusual tilt toward short positions in BTC derivatives despite record prices, CoinDesk reported on Thursday.\n\nRead more: Why Are Bitcoin Traders Aggressively Shorting as BTC Hits New Record High?",
