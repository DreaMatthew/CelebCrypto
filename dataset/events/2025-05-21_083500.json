    "content": "Shiba Inu has displayed conflicting market indicators in recent trading sessions. The token initially demonstrated bullish momentum with significant volume support, but this quickly gave way to intense selling pressure.\n\nTechnical analysis reveals SHIB is consolidating below key resistance levels, with traders closely monitoring the $0.00001450-$0.00001600 zone for potential breakout signals. On-chain metrics paint a concerning picture, with declining whale netflows (-311%) and a substantial 68% decrease in active addresses since December.\n\nThe current market structure suggests continued ranging behavior may precede a decisive directional move, with confirmation requiring a break above the descending trendline resistance at approximately $0.00002044.\n\nWith only 17% of holders currently in profit while over 80% remain underwater, any significant price increase could face substantial selling pressure as investors seek to break even.\n\nAnalysts remain divided on SHIB's near-term prospects, with some identifying potential bullish patterns while others point to weakening fundamentals as cause for caution.\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights\n\nExternal References",
