The subsequent step higher faced consolidation between $92,000 and $96,000.\n\nSimilarly, since May 10, prices have oscillated mainly between $101,000 and $105,000, marking consolidation following the step into six figure territory.\n\nFrom here, advancing to the next phase of gains will require bulls to chew through a substantial number of sell orders at around $105,000, posing a significant resistance barrier.\n\nSell orders worth nearly $50 million were open at $104,800 across major exchanges in addition to the $70 million in selling pressure at $105,000, according to data source Kiyotaka.ai.\n\nThe analytics platform tracks the order book heat map by pulling order book data from spot trading on Binance, Bitstamp, Bybt, Coinbase and OKX and perpetual futures trading on Binance, Bybit and OKX.\n\nAn open order placed above the current market price is usually a sell order. These can be called limit sell orders, setting the minimum price that sellers are willing to accept. When the spot price reaches this level, the order may be executed, allowing the seller to sell at or above that level.\n\nThe chart shows that the global aggregated order book is relatively stacked at higher price levels, hinting at potential profit taking as prices approach lifetime highs.\n\nMacro indicators and technical momentum indicators suggest the path of least resistance is on the higher side, meaning sooner or later bulls will absorb the selling pressure, lifting valuations to record highs.\n\nIn other words, these sell walls won't be there forever.",
