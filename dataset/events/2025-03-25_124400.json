    "summary": "The trading platform is aiming to raise up to $400 million at a valuation of roughly $4.5 billion.",
    "content": "Stocks and crypto trading platform eToro filed to sell shares to the public for the first time on the Nasdaq, marking a renewed push for a listing after a previous attempt stalled in 2021.\n\nIn a prospectus for the initial public offering (IPO), the Bnei Brak, Israel-based company said revenue more than tripled to $12.6 billion last year. The lion’s share came from cryptocurrency-related revenue, which rose to $12.1 billion last year from $3.4 billion in 2023.\n\nFounded in 2007 by Yoni and Ronen Assia, eToro allows users to trade assets including stocks, crypto and commodities, and to copy other traders' portfolios. The company’s IPO plans were revealed earlier this year through reports on a confidential filing with the SEC.\n\nNet income jumped to $192 million in 2024, up from just $15.3 million in 2023 according to data from its recent Form F-1 filing. The company is looking to raise $300 million–$400 million at a valuation of $4.5 billion, Globes reported.\n\nThat’s below the $10.4 billion valuation it sought in 2021 during a planned merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, which was later shelved due to market conditions. The firm has filed to list under the ticker “ETOR.”\n\nThe offering will be led by major underwriters including Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS, and Citigroup.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
