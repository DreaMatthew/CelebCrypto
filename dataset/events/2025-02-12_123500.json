    "author": "Francisco Rodrigues",
    "summary": "The token, trading under the ticker symbol SMLR, saw a 300% rise after launch but then plummeted.",
    "content": "The X account of Semler Scientific chairman Eric Semler has seemingly been compromised, with various posts from it pointing to the supposed creation of a Solana-based token under the same trading symbol that the firm trades under at Nasdaq.\n\nThe account shared a post suggesting that the token is looking to bridge \"institutional-grade Bitcoin exposure to a high-performance ecosystem with deep liquidity and low fees\" by launching the token on Solana.\n\nOther posts suggest a large percentage of the token's supply has been sent to leading cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nA newly launched token trading on Solana-based decentralized exchange Raydium under the ticker symbol SMLR, whose address matches the one sent to the hacked account's posts, saw a 300% rise after launch before seeing a massive plunge.\n\nThe token is now down 77% from its peak, according to DEXScreener data.\n\nCoinDesk has reached out to Semler Scientific for comment.",
