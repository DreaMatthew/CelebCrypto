They stay around the clear value,” Zhao said. “This is indeed a challenge for RWA. Memes are fun, etc. It’s a cultural thing. I am not an expert in this area. There are plenty of die-hard defenders of memes. Don’t go against the community.”\n\nTST got listed on Binance. A few thoughts:\n\n1. CZ said “fundamentals”, then talks about a test coin turned meme coin.\n\nI posted to clarify that TST was NOT endorsed by me/us. It was just a test token used in a video tutorial. But every clarification post just made it more viral…\n\nDavid Portnoy, the influential founder of Barstool Sports, jumped into the memecoin fray on Friday with a coin called \"Montoya por favor,\" inspired by a contestant from the Spanish reality show La Isla De Las Tentaciones.\n\nPortnoy told his 3.5 million X followers that he was \"up a billion percent\" on his first foray into the meme tokens, helping the coins surge to a market capitalization of $14 million at its peak before plummeting down to a $1 million cap within a few hours.\n\nHe has now set his sights on a Josh Allen MVP coin with a playful warning, \"Buy at your own risk. I just bought it. I’m gonna sell it. Don’t buy what ya can’t lose.\" That coin also shot up, hitting a market cap of over $12 million, before nosediving to a capitalization under $100,000.\n\nMarket watchers on X accused him of leading his massive following into a pump-and-dump scheme. But Portnoy defended his trading spree, claiming transparency and even humorously questioning if his actions could land him in jail.\n\nThe world of shitcoins is insane pic.twitter.com/588MgAgDXk\n\nSomeone then issued the JAILSTOOL token, a nod to Portnoy’s tweet…which Portnoy then purchased and promoted to his followers.\n\n“I may dump it eventually but I’ll let all you righteous losers dump on each other first. So don’t put in more than you can lose,” he quipped.\n\nJAILSTOOL surged from $1.2 million to over $200 million at peak, even gaining a spot listing on U.S.-based Kraken on Sunday. It trades at 8 cents in Asian afternoon hours on Monday at a $78 million market capitalization.\n\nHey crypto bros I think whoever made this coin is funny and I want to collect it as a memory of you bitches crying like little babies. I may dump it eventually but I’ll let all you righteous losers dump on each other first. So don’t put in more than you can lose. These hobby… pic.twitter.com/qpp8XpG5WI\n\nHere's where the meme frenzy gets wild — an entire African country has decided to get in on the fun as the Central African Republic apparently issued its CAR memecoin over the weekend.\n\nCAR launched with a promise to aid in national development and to put one of the poorest countries “on the world stage,” its president said on X. The token's market cap soared to around $527 million shortly after issuance, nearly a fourth of the country’s GDP of $2.6 billion.\n\nToday, we are launching $CAR - an experiment designed to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people, support national development, and put the Central African Republic on the world stage in a unique way.\n\nContract: 7oBYdEhV4GkXC19ZfgAvXpJWp2Rn9pm1Bx2cVNxFpump\n\n“As the second president in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, I have always recognized the potential of crypto and its benefits on a global scale,” Faustin-Archange Touadéra said, linking to CAR’s website.\n\nBut suspicions abound around CAR’s issuance, with the site’s domain provider taking it down late Sunday and some X users allegeding Touadéra’s video to be a deepfake.\n\nSolana decentralized exchange Jupiter said early Monday it had reached out to CAR representations for further validity of the token and its official connection to the country.\n\nok, looks like we are in touch with the team who deployed the coin and we are able to verify by doing a number of onchain txns live.\n\nthis includes:\n- getting them to redo the initially cancellable contract\n- tracking the key deployer txns from mint to lock\n- sending them to burn… https://t.co/s01OVymMeE\n\nJupiter said it was able to verify the token’s deployers using an onchain transaction, but further confirmation and exact relation to the president’s office remain pending as of Asian afternoon hours.",
