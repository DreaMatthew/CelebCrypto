    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe crypto market remains directionless, with bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nlanguishing below $100,000 before the U.S. jobs report. It's surprising prices have not yet crossed that threshold, especially after President Donald Trump's son, Eric, encouraged the family-linked WLFI to invest in BTC in a post on X on Thursday.\n\nTypically, such endorsements during a bull run lead to substantial gains. That that hasn't materialized is a sign markets are no longer buoyed by talk alone and Trump needs to walk the walk. Early this week, the administration said it's evaluating the feasibility of a strategic BTC reserve.\n\nAnother possibility is that caution ahead of nonfarm payrolls is capping the upside. If that's the case, a breakout may occur once the data is out, especially if the figure prints weaker than estimated, potentially driving Treasury yields and the dollar index lower.\n\nCrypto newsletter service LondonCryptoClub recommends keeping an eye on revisions in the previous figures. \"Bloomberg Intelligence expecting some large downside revisions suggesting the Labour market not as strong in 2024 as first appeared We still think the market (and the Fed themselves) are massively under pricing the rate cuts that will need to come,\" the newsletter service's founders said on X.\n\nAt press time, Volmex's one-day bitcoin implied volatility index stood at an annualized 51%, suggesting a daily price swing of 2.6%, or about $2,600. In other words, the figure could move the spot price by $2,600 in either direction. Notably, some traders are buying put options, bracing for potential downside volatility should the data come in strong.\n\nIn other news, the \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve\" bill passed the House in the state of Utah and will now move to the Senate. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported that the U.S. SEC has acknowledged Grayscale's Solana 19b-4 filing. And VanEck predicted a $500 price for SOL, more than double its current value of around $180.\n\nAdditionally, FOX reporter Eleanor Terrett shared that U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill and Digital Assets Subcommittee Chairman Bryan Steil have released a stablecoin regulation discussion draft, which proposes a two-year ban on stablecoins backed solely by self-issued digital assets and mandates a Treasury study on their risks.\n\nAnd finally, Berachain's BERA token, which debuted yesterday, has already recorded a staggering perpetual trading volume of $4.8 billion, with its price currently sitting at $7.60, a significant drop from yesterday's peak of $14. Stay alert!\n\nCoinDesk's Consensus to take place in Hong Kong on Feb. 18-20 and in Toronto on May 14-16.
