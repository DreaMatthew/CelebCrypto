    "content": "Shares of eToro climbed nearly 29% in their debut on the Nasdaq exchange after going public at a roughly $4.2 billion valuation on Tuesday.\n\nStock indexes saw mixed results on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq trading higher and the Dow Industrials lower. Bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,723.54\ndrifted modestly lower to $103,400..\n\nEToro had sold nearly 6 million shares for its IPO at $52 each, much higher than its initially marketed range and raising about $310 million.\n\nThe stock and crypto trading platform became the first company to resume plans to go public after a number other crypto-related companies including stablecoin issuers Circle delayed their IPOs amid April's market uncertainty. All eyes are now on the others to see if they will follow in eToro’s steps, especially given its successful debut.\n\nCORRECT (May 15, 13:14 UTC): Removes reference to Robinhood delaying its IPO. The company is already publicly traded.",
