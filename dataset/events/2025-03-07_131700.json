    "content": "The DXY Index, has experienced one of its sharpest one-week declines since 2013. The index measures the strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg data from Global Macro Investor, the index’s one-week percentage drop has exceeded a negative four standard deviation move—a rare event that has only occurred three other times in bitcoin's\nBTC\n$104,257.93\nhistory.\n\nThese previous occurrences include November 2022, when bitcoin hit its cycle low of $15,500 during the FTX collapse; March 2020, amid the covid 19 pandemic, when bitcoin briefly fell below $5,000; and the 2015 bear market, when bitcoin traded around $250. Each time the DXY Index suffered a drop larger than a -4 standard deviation, it coincided with a bitcoin bottom, followed by significant price gains.\n\nAdditionally, CoinDesk research highlights that the DXY Index is currently declining at a faster rate than in President Trump's first term— a period that aligned with the 2017 bitcoin bull run. A decline in the DXY Index tends to be favourable for risk-assets, however a DXY index above 100, is still considered strong, currently at 103.8.",
