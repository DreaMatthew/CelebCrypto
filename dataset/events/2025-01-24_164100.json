    "content": "Many participants in industry hackathons are just looking to make some quick prize money and move on to the next contest — Dominic Kwok calls them “bounty hunters.”\n\nBut EasyA, the start-up for developers that he and his brother Phil started four years ago, is looking for a different type of competitor — those who are looking to build companies that can have a significant impact on Web3. It’s an approach that has proved fruitful, with the companies coming out of EasyA’s app community and monthly in-person hackathons having raised money at a collective valuation of over $3 billion from top VC firms such as a16z crypto and CMT Digital. And EasyA’s mobile app, which helps developers easily start building their own Web3 projects, has over a million users worldwide.\n\nAt the first EasyA Consensus hackathon in Austin last May, more than 700 participants launched 100 different crypto projects, and the Kwoks are expecting similar numbers for upcoming events at Consensus Hong Kong and Consensus Toronto (if you’d like to apply for the EasyA Hackathon at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, please go here).\n\nHere they discuss why their unique approach to hackathons, how they expect Consensus Hong Kong will differ from hackathons in other parts of the world and how Donald Trump’s election could affect the types of projects crypto developers focus on.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong.

Anyone can use the EasyA app on iOS and Android to learn about the top Layer Ones out there, like Solana, Polkadot, Stellar and Ripple’s XRP Ledger. And people can learn how to not only develop, but also launch their own projects. We also host a lot of big hackathons in person all around the world, in which hundreds of people come in person and launch projects on our blockchain partners. And the goal is to get these people not just launching, but then also founding and building startups that go on to get funded by the ecosystem and VCs.\n\nHow do you approach hackathons differently than other companies that run these?\n\nDominic: Two things. The first is that EasyA is very focused on founders who want to start their own companies, versus hackathon “bounty hunters.” We really want to make sure that our participants actually stick around and build their projects because that’s where we see the future of Web3 really being built from. And the second thing is most of our hackathons are single chain, so participants focus on one piece of tech and they actually launch on that one, as opposed to focusing on 50 different chains. We want to put people in front of the best ecosystems that have the most support for developers.\n\nHow do you think the Consensus hackathon in Hong Kong will be different from those you hold in other parts of the world?\n\nDominic: The scale is just going to be super big. We've already had a record number of people apply for the seats in the arena. We'll obviously have people from Hong Kong, but then also from other Asian countries like India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and China. And we're also seeing huge numbers of people from the West want to come. For many of those people, it'll be the first time they've actually been to Asia.\n\nDo you expect there to be differences in the types of projects that developers in Asia pursue, as opposed to those in other parts of the world?\n\nPhil: There's a geographical element and then there's also a thematic one. A huge theme that we've seen come up over the past couple of weeks is AI x Web3, and a lot of developers are excited about that intersection. We've also seen protocols like virtuals really kick off and become very successful, so I think we'll see a lot of that. Geographically, in Asia there are obviously so many different currencies, and we're seeing that developers there actually understand those cross-border use cases a lot better. If you're a U.S.-based developer, you don't necessarily see those friction points a ton. So I think that we're going to see a lot more of the cross border payment solutions start to flesh themselves out.\n\nHow do you think Donald Trump’s presidency will affect the kinds of projects you see at your hackathons?\n\nPhil: Obviously DeFi has always been one of the biggest areas of product market fit in crypto — arguably one of the few that actually has that fit. But so far because of, frankly, how scared a lot of developers were in the States, a lot of people just weren't building nor launching in the U.S. And so you'd often go on to a decentralized app and it'll say “Oh, you're in the States, you can't use this.” So that’s a very visible area where we're going to start seeing changes. Another area where you can't participate if you’re from the U.S. is airdrops. So if you are an end user, you couldn't really access a lot of crypto. And if you wanted to target this demographic, which of course is the wealthiest in the world, you couldn't. So I think DeFi is really going to explode, especially in the States.\n\nBoth of you are also speakers at Consensus Hong Kong. What will you be talking about?\n\nDominic: Our keynote will be about why it's so hard right now for Web3 ecosystems to attract developers now. And we're going to be giving some of our tips on how they can attract developers more easily and at a bigger scale. Right now, Web3 firms are competing over the same developers, and the growth of Web3 devs has pretty much stagnated. And obviously at EasyA, our whole mission is actually to bring way more developers into the space. That starts with making it easy. But we’re also making several big tech upgrades that will allow developers to build much more easily on-chain. And we're going to be revealing those on stage.",
