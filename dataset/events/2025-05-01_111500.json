    "content": "By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe impact of President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs is starting to be felt. The U.S. economy contracted for the first time in three years last quarter and stock prices have seen their worst first 100-day performance of a presidential administration since 1974.\n\nResults from trading platform Robinhood also showed markets cooled in the first three months of the year, even as it beat analyst forecasts for both revenue and earnings per share.\n\nIt wasn't alone, major tech companies including Microsoft and Meta beat estimates and, crucially, Robinhood's revenue from crypto doubled from the year-earlier quarter. That may foreshadow what to look for later today, when Block, Riot Platforms, Strategy and Reddit post results after the closing bell.\n\n“The recent wave of weak macroeconomic data has pointed to both recessionary risks and rising inflation,” James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, told CoinDesk. “Despite this, bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, outperforming the Nasdaq by 11% since 'Liberation Day'” on April 2.\n\nIndeed, while first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.3% and major stock indexes post posted losses in last month, bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nheld strong. The largest cryptocurrency rose nearly 15% against the dollar in April as investors started using it as a safe haven, along with gold and the Swiss franc.\n\nTo Butterfill, risk assets are now seemingly benefiting from expectations of an earlier-than-expected interest-rate cut.\n\n“Equities and bitcoin appear to have recoupled, both rebounding today on renewed hopes of an imminent interest-rate cut,\" he said. \"A disappointing payroll figure on Friday — which we see as likely — could be the final nail in the coffin for Powell, paving the way for more dovish policy from the Fed.\"\n\nYet in the cryptocurrency space, there’s more to keep an eye on. Ethereum’s long-awaited Pectra upgrade, which includes improvements to make the network more user-friendly and efficient, is going live on mainnet on May 7.\n\nThe upgrade is significant for Ethereum, which has been losing ground to more efficient blockchains including Solana, Base and BNB chain. DeFiLlama data shows total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum’s smart contracts grew just 4% in April, compared with 21% on Solana, and 9.9% on BNB Chain. Base saw a minor contraction.\n\nIn the past year, Artemis data shows Ethereum net outflows totaled $3.3 billion, while Base and Solana saw $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion in net inflows, respectively. Still, Ethereum recorded $880 million in net inflows in April, suggesting the trend is reversing ahead of Pectra’s activation.\n\nThe trend has, however, taken its toll. The ETH/BTC ratio has dropped to little over 0.19, the lowest level in five years. Stay alert!\n\nCoinDesk's Consensus is taking place in Toronto on May 14-16. Use code DAYBOOK and save 15% on passes.\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
