    "summary": "The price action came as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 stock indexes fell sharply early Monday as Trump failed to quell worries about a recession.",
    "content": "Cryptocurrencies extended a sell-off on Monday as risk assets including equities tanked during the early U.S. hours.\n\nFollowing a bounce to around $84,000 earlier in the day, perhaps buoyed by Strategy's $21 billion fundraising plan, bitcoin (BTC) slid below $80,000, down 3.8% over 24 hours. The Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH) briefly slipped below $2,000, to trade near its weakest price since November 2023, down around 4%.\n\nThe broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index fell 5%, with Solana's SOL, Cardano's ADA and Aptos' APT, Avalanche's AVAX and NEAR losing between 7% and 10%.\n\nThe ugly action in crypto markets came as the already-battered U.S. equity indexes opened the week sharply lower, weighing on sentiment. The Nasdaq tumbled over 3% in the early hours of the session, while the S&P 500 declined 2%.\n\nCrypto equities also felt the heat. Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC holder, and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) lost more than 10%.\n\nWith the digital asset summit at the White House and President Donald Trump's Bitcoin reserve executive order already behind us, crypto markets have run out of near-term positive catalysts and are increasingly weighed down by concerns about a tariff war and a slowing economy.\n\nThe economy is in a \"transition\" phase, Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday, refusing to rule out a recession this year.\n\n\"Until crypto finds a new narrative, we're likely to see an increased correlation between BTC and equities in the near term,\" hedge fund QCP said in a Telegram broadcast. \"Both risk assets are currently trading near their recent lows, and with tariff risks still looming, volatility could pick up heading into key U.S. macro data releases.\"",
