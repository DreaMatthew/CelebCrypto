    "content": "Memecoin generator Pump.fun has launched a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices, making its platform more accessible to users and effectively doubling down on the ongoing memecoin craze.\n\nPump.fun’s new mobile app has features similar to its web interface. It allows users to create their own Solana-based memecoins for free and trade existing tokens while on the go. In an announcement on Friday, the firm detailed that the app includes tools for users to manage their memecoins portfolios and create customized watchlists to monitor tokens.\n\nThe launch comes just weeks after Pump.fun was hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit accusing the firm and its executives of violations of U.S. securities laws. It also comes at a time when the ongoing memecoin trend only appears to be accelerating.\n\nBobby Ong, co-founder and COO of cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko, has highlighted on social media that 600,000 new tokens were launched in January of this year alone, a 12-fold increase over the same period in 2024.\n\nOng attributes the explosion in token launches to a new monthly record to token launchpads like Pump.fun, which simplify the process of creating a token and allow its users to do so even without any technical expertise.\n\nWhile it’s now easier than ever to launch new tokens, Ong also pointed out that new blockchains and decentralized exchanges are growing rapidly. At this rate, he said, there could be 1 billion tokens in circulation “in the next five years.”\n\nThe sheer number of new tokens being launched could be fragmenting available liquidity and attention. “Too many tokens, each spreading the limited attention and liquidity of traders even thinner. That’s why we don’t see the great alt pumps of previous cycles,” Ong said on social media.\nRead more: CZ's Dog Made a Killing for One Memecoin Creator and Murdered Everyone Else",
