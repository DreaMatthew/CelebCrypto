    "content": "DeFi Development Corp. (JNVR), formerly known as Janover, is doubling down on its plan to buy more Solana for its treasury as it looks to offer up to $1 billion worth of securities.\n\nThe firm, formerly a commercial real estate lending tech platform, revealed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that it plans on using the funds for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Solana.” The offering will include common and preferred stock, debt instruments, warrants, and units.\n\nDeFi Development has already acquired approximately $48.2 million of SOL and plans to operate validators on the Solana blockchain to earn staking rewards.\n\nTaking a playbook out of Michael Saylor's bitcoin buying strategy, corporations have been increasingly buying SOL for their balance sheets to provide TradFi investors with exposure to the token.\n\nSOL Strategies, the publicly traded company helmed by CEO Leah Wald—former co-founder of digital asset manager Valkyrie Investments—spearheaded the movement. Recently, the firm announced that it had secured an up to $500 million convertible note facility to ramp up its investments in the Solana network.\n\nDeFi Development's new offering comes after a significant leadership shakeup earlier this month. Former Kraken executive Joseph Onorati took over as CEO and chairman, and Parker White, another ex-Kraken engineer, was named chief operating officer and chief investment officer. The company also brought on John Han, a former Binance and Kraken executive, as CFO. DeFi Development adopted a treasury strategy centered around Solana as part of its new direction.\n\nIn addition to the $1 billion shelf registration, DeFi Development also filed to register 1.24 million shares on behalf of early investors, including Pantera Capital, Payward (parent company of Kraken), and Arrington Capital.\n\nShares of DeFi Development Corp surged more than 970% following the leadership shakeup and moved up roughly 4% in after-hours trading on Friday to now stand at $54 per share.\n\nDisclaimer: This article, or parts of it, was generated with assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
