    "content": "The Gibraltar government said it plans to establish the world's first rules for the clearing and settlement of crypto derivatives, creating a regulatory framework to improve market integrity and reduce key risks.\n\nWorking with the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) and crypto exchange Bullish (whose owner, Bullish Group, is also the parent of CoinDesk), the government has built a framework over the past six months that tailors traditional financial clearing regulations to the virtual asset market.\n\nThe framework will enable virtual asset derivative contracts to be cleared and settled by a recognized clearing house, Bullish said on Tuesday.\n\nClearing houses ensure that trades are finalized, with buyers and sellers meeting their commitments. Many virtual asset exchanges have been performing that function which, in the absence of regulatory oversight, can lead to failures in the process, Bullish said.\n\nThe proposed regime will allow the establishment of separate clearing houses with \"improved transparency and capitalization,\" it said.\n\nRead More: UK's First FCA-Regulated Crypto Derivatives Trading Venue GFO-X Debuts in London\n\nCORRECT (May 13, 15:34 UTC): Corrects that CoinDesk's parent company is Bullish Group, not the crypto exchange Bullish.",
