    "summary": "The Nasdaq-listed firm has accumulated 595,988 in Solana's SOL, worth nearly $105 million, in the month since its crypto pivot.",
    "content": "DeFi Development (DFDV), the Nasdaq-listed real estate tech firm formerly known as Janover, bought more of Solana's SOL\nSOL\n$156.85\n, taking its total crypto holdings above $100 million, the company announced on Monday.\n\nThe firm said it acquired 172,670 SOL at an average price of $136.81. The $23.6 million purchase is the largest since its crypto pivot last month. The Florida-based company now holds 595,988 SOL, worth nearly $105 million at current prices.\n\nThe company said the tokens will be held long-term and staked with a range of validators, including its own, to earn staking yield. DeFi Development's updated per-share exposure now stands at 0.293 SOL or about $50.42 per share.\n\nThe company's shares surged 20% to $90 in the early minutes of the Monday session, adding to the 30% gain on Friday as crypto prices rallied over the past few days. SOL advanced over 20% over the past week, touching $180 for the first time since February.\n\nThe move reflects a growing trend of public companies buying cryptocurrencies for their balance sheets, mimicking the playbook of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).\n\nWhile many companies are following Saylor's lead and focusing on bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\n, the largest cryptocurrency, others are looking at alternatives. Last month, Janover was taken over by a group of former executives of crypto exchange Kraken and pivoted to focus on the Solana blockchain, accumulating the network's native token and operating validators to earn a staking yield. The firm recently laid out plans to raise $1 billion for acquiring SOL.\n\nRead more: DeFi Development Plans to Raise $1 Billion to Buy More Solana\n\nDisclaimer: This article, or parts of it, was generated with assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
