    "summary": "The NXPC token is developed by NEXPACE, the blockchain arm of South Korean video game developer Nexon.",
    "content": "Several exchanges including Binance and Korean platform Coinone have listed\nNXPC\n$0.3332\n, leading to a 115% surge in the token's value on the back of $1 billion in trading volume in the first three hours of trading.\n\nNEXPACE is a PC role-playing game that features on-chain item ownership. It is the the blockchain arm of South Korean video game developer Nexon.\n\nBinance Alpha users that have accumulated 187 Alpha points can claim 198 NXPC, worth $629 at current prices. Points are accrued by holding crypto tokens on the Binance exchange or in the Binance wallet.\n\nBinance's Alpha product is a way of distributing newly-launched tokens to users by accumulating points. It caused a stir in December when the platform's Chinese social media channel unintentionally posted a list of tokens that would potentially be launched, prompting the tokens to spike then crash back down.\n\nNXPC has debuted at a $550 million market cap with a fully diluted value (FDV) of $3.2 billion. FDV is calculated by multiplying the total supply by asset price, whilst market cap only considers circulating supply.\n\nMore than $240 million of the $1 billion trading volume took place on Binance, with traders on Korean exchange Upbit also racking up $100 million worth of volume.",
