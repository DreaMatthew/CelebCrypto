It would oversee policy development as well as collaborate with countries to develop standardised frameworks, the report added, citing a statement from the finance ministry.\n\nTill last year, the nation's finance ministry had been opposed to regulating crypto in the country, however Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said he would look into the matter with an open mind, he said in a statement. He also stressed the importance of a well-regulated digital asset framework, the report added.\n\nAurangzeb also attended a meeting with a foreign delegation said to include President Donald Trump's digital asset advisors on Tuesday.\n\nNations have been looking at the U.S. which has been moving to create crypto-friendly policies since the election of Trump.\n\nCoinDesk could not reach out to the Finance Ministry for comment.",
