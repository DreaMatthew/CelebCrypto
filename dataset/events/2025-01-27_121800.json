Alongside, the company announced a preferred share offering of roughly $250 million as it opened up a new front to raise money to purchase even more BTC.\n\nThe firm, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, announced that the Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock (STRK) will have a $100 liquidation preference. Each share of STRK is initially convertible into one-tenth of a share of Class A common stock, effectively setting a $1,000 implied conversion price per Class A share. STRK will also pay an $8 per share cumulative annual preferred dividend, according to Saylor.\n\nThe announcement came after MicroStrategy increased its bitcoin holdings for the 12th straight week.\n\nIn the week ended Jan. 26, the company bought 10,107 BTC, taking its total stack to 471,107 BTC, Saylor wrote in a post on X. The purchase, at an average price of $105,596 per bitcoin, raised MicroStrategy's overall average purchase price to $64,511.\n\nSaylor teased the announcement on Sunday, as he has done in recent weeks, posting: \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.\"\n\nOn Jan. 21, MicroStrategy shareholders approved increasing the authorized number of Class A common shares to 10.3 billion from 330 million shares.\n\nMicroStrategy also filed a mixed securities shelf registration that now includes: debt securities, preferred stock, warrants and depository shares in addition to Class A common stock.\n\nUPDATE (Jan. 27, 13:21 UTC): Adds details on MicroStrategy's mixed securities registration.\nUPDATE (Jan. 27, 13:40 UTC): Adds details on firm's preferred share offering.",
