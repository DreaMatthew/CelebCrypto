Customers pay by scanning a QR code or using the KuCoin app, the exchange said in a press release.\n\nThe exchange joins a number of crypto payment providers in facilitating direct payments for customers, a feature that’s supposed to bridge the gap between crypto and the legacy payments infrastructure.\n\nIn August, for example, digital payments platform Flexa announced a similar product with retailers including Chipotle, Mikimoto, Regal Cinemas and 99 Ranch Market.\n\nThe new infrastructure supports 54 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin\nBTC\n$107,661.53\n, ether\nETH\n$3,722.54\nand the USDT and USDC stablecoins.\n\nSeveral merchants, who expect to launch the feature in January, have signed up for the product, a spokesperson for KuCoin said. Their names cannot be disclosed at this time.",
