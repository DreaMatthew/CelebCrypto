    "content": "The U.S. Congress' opening priority for the crypto industry is to quickly finish a stablecoin oversight bill, and the House of Representatives has released the text of its version on Wednesday, following in the heels of a recent committee approval of its Senate counterpart.\n\nThe House version, introduced by Rep. Bryan Steil, who leads the House Financial Services Committee's crypto panel, and Rep. French Hill, the Republican chair of the overall committee, governs the way companies can issue dollar-denominated digital tokens.\n\nThe new version will \"close the gap\" between the House efforts and the Senate version of the bill, Steil said during a conference appearance Wednesday.\n\nThe Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) \"is a strong continuation of our work on digital assets in the last Congress,\" Hill said in a statement.\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee had already advanced its own version of the legislation with a strong bipartisan vote, so it moves on now to consideration on the Senate floor. Rep. Tom Emmer, the House majority whip who has been among Congress' top crypto advocates for years, said the two bills have \"some minor differences that I'm sure can be ironed out.\"\n\nRead more: Trump-Tied World Liberty Financial Pitches Its Stablecoin in Washington With Don Jr.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Emmer reintroduced his Securities Clarity Act, which seeks to define how a crypto asset might fall within the securities law framework. Emmer introduced the bill, which was part of last year's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT 21), alongside Democratic Representative Darren Soto.\n\nEmmer, Steil and many other lawmakers involved in crypto efforts on Capitol Hill all appeared on Wednesday at the DC Blockchain Summit, a crypto policy event hosted by the Digital Chamber. Most of them shared hopes that the stablecoin effort would be completed by August.\n\nAs the conference wrapped up, the Senate prepared to vote for a second time on a Congressional Review Act resolution overturning the IRS' 2024 regulation governing decentralized finance (DeFi) brokers. The Senate and House have both previously passed the resolution, which U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign, but the Senate needed vote on it again due to a procedural rule requiring the House to vote first on tax-related issues.\n\nThe vote passed, with 70 Senators voting in support and 28 voting against. The previous Senate vote passed 70-27.\n\nIn a statement, DeFi Education Fund Executive Director and Chief Legal Officer Amanda Tuminelli said the group \"commends the bipartisan supermajority of Congressional leaders who voted in favor of the “DeFi Broker” CRA resolution, recognizing the severe and far-reaching consequences of the IRS’ misguided rulemaking.\"\n\nUPDATE (March 27, 2025, 00:49 UTC): Adds Senate vote update.",
