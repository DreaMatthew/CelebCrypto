    "summary": "Sun has invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project backed by the Trump family.",
    "content": "Tron founder Justin Sun said he's the top holder of the TRUMP memecoin, entitling him to attend a private dinner and a VIP reception with U.S. President Donald Trump this week.\n\nA Solana address apparently associated with Sun holds roughly $21.9 million worth of the TRUMP coin, placing him at the top of the leaderboard in a sweepstakes that rewards the biggest token holders with access to Trump at a golf club near Washington, D.C. The leaderboard appears on a website publicized by Trump on his X account.\n\nSun is also a backer of World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by the Trump family, having invested invested $75 million. The project’s co-founder, Zak Folkman, has credited the Chinese-born crypto billionaire for its success.\n\nThe TRUMP token debuted just days before the president's inauguration in January and was met with criticism from across the crypto industry and elsewhere. Critics pointed to its timing of the launch and its structure, which allocates a large portion of the supply to Trump-affiliated insiders.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, have argued that Trump’s crypto effort is eroding ethical norms. They’ve introduced bills to block public officials from launching or endorsing digital assets.\n\nThe White House responded to the scrutiny by downplaying it, rejecting allegations of conflicts of interest and framing the criticism as partisan disruption.\n\nTrump’s memecoin, it’s worth noting, saw a major price rise over the event’s announcement. The dinner falls on Bitcoin Pizza Day, which commemorates one of the earliest bitcoin\nBTC\n$106,345.69\ntransactions.\n\nTRUMP is trading at $14.40, up 8.3% in the last 24 hours.",
