ADA holders gain real voting power – on parameter changes, treasury withdrawals, hard forks, and the blockchain’s future,\" Cardano Foundation said. \"[It's] A milestone in blockchain governance.\"\n\nCardano's ADA token changed hands at 93 cents at press time, up 1.4% on the day, according to data from CoinDesk and TradingView. A hard fork is a non-backwards compatible change to the blockchain's programming.\n\nThe Plomin hard fork needs Stake Pool Operators to upgrade their nodes and approve the upgrade with a 51% vote. As of last week, nearly 80% of nodes had elevated to the new version.",
