    "content": "Crypto exchange Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle a case with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission over allegedly misleading statements it made more than seven years ago about how easily the price of a bitcoin futures contract could be manipulated.\n\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss' exchange settled without admitting or denying liability, according to a letter on Monday from the CFTC's attorney, K. Brent Tomer. A trial for the case had been set to start Jan. 21, but that will no longer proceed.\n\nThe CFTC sued Gemini in 2022, alleging it had misled the U.S. regulator during in-person meetings that occurred in 2017.\n\nPart of the deal also included an injunction to prevent Gemini from making false or misleading statements to the commission in the future. These types of injunctions are common in settlements or lawsuits by federal securities and commodities regulators.\n\nGemini also faces another case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A judge ruled in March that the SEC could sue the exchange for violating securities laws.\n\nIn the absence of legislation relating specifically to the crypto industry, U.S. regulators have sued a number of crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, for violating securities laws.\n\nMany observers have said pro-crypto comments made by President-elect Donald Trump indicate he will appoint regulators with a less confrontational attitude to the industry and a reduction in so-called regulation by enforcement.",
