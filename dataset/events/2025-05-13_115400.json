    "content": "Robinhood Markets (HOOD), the California-based financial services company, said it agreed to buy Canadian crypto firm WonderFi (WNDR) for $178.98 million.\n\nThe all-cash acquisition values WonderFi at 36 Canadian cents per share, a 41% premium over its closing price prior to the Tuesday announcement.\n\n“WonderFi has built a formidable family of brands serving beginner and advanced crypto users alike, making them an ideal partner to accelerate Robinhood’s mission in Canada,” said Johann Kerbrat, head of Robinhood Crypto, in the official announcement. Kerbrat will be speaking at Consensus Toronto on Friday.\n\nRobinhood, a popular commission-free brokerage platform, has been looking to expand its international footprint for some time and struck a deal to acquire cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp last year.\n\nThe latest acquisition will help it win over Canada-based customers. Toronto-listed WonderFi owns and operates Bitbuy and Coinsquare, two leading crypto platforms in the country. Trading volume on WonderFi, whose CEO Dean Skurka will speak at Consensus on Thursday, increased 28% to C$3.57 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe deal will bring Robinhood into Canada, ramping up competition for exchanges such as Coinbase and Wealthsimple Crypto.\n\nCrypto merger and acquisition activity has picked up the pace with the U.S. President Donald Trump adopting a crypto-friendly approach. Last Week, Nasdaq-listed Coinbase made a bold bet on digital assets derivatives segment, acquiring crypto options giant Deribit in a landmark $2.9 billion deal.\n\nUPDATE (May 13, 14:43 UTC): Adds executives' appearances at Consensus Toronto.",
