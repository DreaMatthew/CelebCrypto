    "author": "James Van Straten",
    "summary": "Strategy and Coinbase lead the crypto-equity rally in pre-market trading, both up double digits.",
    "content": "Crypto-equities have rebounded following Donald Trump’s crypto strategic reserve announcement. With just hours until the U.S. market opens, bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nremains above $92,000, recovering from its recent drop to $78,000.\n\nAs a result, crypto-related stocks have jumped after significant declines—Strategy (MSTR) rebounded 12% after dropping as much as 50% from its November high. Coinbase (COIN) and MARA (MARA) gained 10%, and IREN (IREN) rose 11%.\n\nGlassnode data shows that bitcoin also went above the Short-Term Holder Realized Price (STH RP) which is priced at $92,107, a key metric tracking the average on-chain cost for investors over the past 155 days. Historically, holding above this level signals a bullish continuation, though temporary dips occur, like in October 2023 and 2024, before further upside.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
