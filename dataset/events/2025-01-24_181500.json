    "content": "The DePIN revolution is coming to a fast food franchise near you. The movement that started with Helium and has spread to numerous categories, including mapping and car data, this year is now spreading to hospitality. The initiative shows how quickly DePINs — or decentralized networks of physical infrastructure — are becoming mainstream.\n\nThe fast food and hospitality industry, often associated with consistency and efficiency, is quietly upgrading as decentralized technologies make their way into the mainstream. The adoption of DePIN by major franchises like Taco Bell and KFC signals a shift in how these businesses operate and engage with technology.\n\nAt the core of this transformation is the integration of DePIN devices — sensors, routers, and other physical infrastructure — powered by blockchain and token-based incentives. These networks enable businesses to contribute to shared ecosystems while gaining real-time operational insights and being rewarded for their participation. It’s a forward-thinking approach that combines cutting-edge technology with the practical needs of fast-food and hospitality businesses, paving the way for greater efficiency, sustainability and customer satisfaction.\n\nWith DePIN, the industry is embracing a strategic evolution — one that reflects the growing potential of decentralized technologies to enhance traditional models while creating new opportunities for growth.\n\nFor franchisees, the potential benefits of DePIN are significant. By integrating DePIN devices into their operations, they can unlock a wealth of opportunities:\n\nA prime example of DePIN's impact on the franchise industry is the partnership between major fast-food chains and Ambient Network, the largest decentralized air quality network on Solana. By deploying air quality sensors across hundreds of stores, from coast to coast, these franchises are not only improving air quality for their customers but also contributing to a cleaner environment. Moreover, they are generating valuable data insights that can be used to optimize operations and reduce costs.\n\n“With the growing maturity of tokens and decentralized technologies, we’re seeing a shift in how we can use these assets within our stores and properties,” explains Pushpak Patel, Founding Principal at CMG Companies, one of the largest operators of KFC, Taco Bell, Sonic, Little Caesars, Rent-A-Center, and Ace Hardware franchises in the US.\n\n“By installing 1,000 DePIN devices from Ambient Network, we’re enhancing our ability to gather operational insights across our locations. Having air quality sensors installed doesn’t just provide real-time conditions, both outdoor and indoor — it also enables us to participate in demand-response programs. And with the strategic density of our locations, we can help unlock greater coverage for the network, which in turn generates additional data insights. This is a game-changer.”\n\nFranchisees may partner with third parties to deploy and manage the infrastructure, or they can manage the devices in-house to improve operational efficiency with the devices and potentially generate an excellent return on investment. With Helium, these deployer participants are seeing ROI from a few dollars to tens of dollars per day based on factors like location, miner density and network demand.\n\nParami Investors, one of the largest deployers of Helium and Ambient devices in North America, has also been bullish on DePIN opportunities for franchise locations. We are clearly seeing greater adoption by retailers and hospitality providers to adopt and deploy decentralized solutions such as Helium and Ambient. Ambient is now deployed across highly dense commercial shopping and dining centers like the Japanese Village Plaza in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo district, hotels like the Best Western in Las Vegas and fast food chains like Taco Bell, KFC and Five Guys. Revolutions start on the street with franchisees pushing the envelope for wider corporate adoption.\n\nAs DePIN technology continues to mature, we can expect to see even more innovative applications in the franchise industry. From decentralized energy grids like Powerledger and community-powered solar from Glow, to blockchain-based loyalty programs from Hang, the possibilities are endless.\n\nFor fast food retailers and franchisees, deploying DePIN devices is not just a technological trend — it’s an investment in a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable future. From generating passive income to collecting valuable data and optimizing operations, the benefits are clear. As the technology continues to evolve, franchisees and other small businesses will find even more ways to leverage DePIN devices to improve both the customer experience and their bottom line.\n\nDecentralized solutions are building an ecosystem that benefits everyone, driving participation through incentives. And DePIN devices are a key part of that vision. By embracing these new technologies, franchisees are setting themselves up for long-term success, ensuring that they remain competitive in an ever-changing market.",
