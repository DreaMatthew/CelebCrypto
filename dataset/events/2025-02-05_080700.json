    "content": "Ondo Finance, a leading tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer, has unveiled a new offering to accelerate the onboarding of traditional assets to blockchain technology.\n\nOndo on Tuesday introduced Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a platform dedicated to providing onchain access to stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe specific details regarding which stocks, bonds, and ETFs will be available is not known yet. Ondo, with a market cap of over $600 million, is already the world's third-largest tokenized Treasury issuer, according to data source rwa.xyz.\n\nThe new offering will help bypass what Ondo calls a broken investment ecosystem characterized by high fees, restricted access, platform fragmentation that locks millions out of capital markets and stifles innovation.\n\n\"By leveraging blockchain technology, we can bring institutional-grade financial markets onchain, making them more accessible, transparent and efficient,\" Ondo said on X.\n\nDrawing inspiration from stablecoin liquidity, Ondo GM will allow the creation of freely transferable tokens linked to stocks, bonds and ETFs with controls in place that determine who can access, buy, or sell the tokens.\n\nOndo's inaugural summit will be held in New York on Feb. 6. The platform has promised major announcements each day leading up to the event.",
