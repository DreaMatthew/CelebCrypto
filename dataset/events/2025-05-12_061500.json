    "summary": "Japan’s Metaplanet said Monday it had purchased another 1,241 bitcoin (BTC), bringing total holdings to nearly 6,800.",
    "content": "Tokyo-listed investment firm Metaplanet has added another 1,241 bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nto its treasury, spending 18.4 billion yen (or $126 million at currency exchange rates) in its latest purchase, per a Monday disclosure.\n\nThe acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 6,796 BTC, worth over $706 million at current market prices. That has sent it above bitcoin-stacking nation El Salvador’s stash of 6,174 BTC, data from the country’s Bitcoin Office shows.\n\nThe purchase was made at an average price of just over $102,119 per bitcoin, marking the firm’s most aggressive buy yet since launching its Bitcoin Treasury Operations in April 2024.\n\nThe firm said its BTC Yield, a proprietary performance indicator measuring bitcoin accumulation per share outstanding, stood at 38% for Q2 to date, after reaching 95.6% in Q1 2025 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. This metric, along with BTC Gain and BTC yen Gain, is used to evaluate shareholder value creation through non-dilutive bitcoin growth.\n\nMetaplanet aims to hit 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, with its treasury strategy increasingly mirroring the high-conviction accumulation playbook pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR), which holds over 555,000 BTC globally.\n\nMetaplanet remains the largest publicly traded bitcoin holder in Asia and ranks 11th globally, as of Monday.",
