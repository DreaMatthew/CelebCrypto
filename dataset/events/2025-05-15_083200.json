    "content": "ARK Invest didn't wait around to add eToro (ETOR) to its portfolio.\n\nCathie Wood's St Petersburg, California-based investment management company bought 140,000 shares in eToro on the stock-and-crypto trading platform's Nasdaq debut on Wednesday.\n\nThe firm's ETOR allocation is worth just under $9.4 million, based on the closing price of $67. The shares rose 29% on the first day of trading after opening at $52, which itself was significantly higher than the marketed range as eToro received much higher demand than anticipated.\n\nARK also bought 275,000 shares of 3Iq's Solana staking ETF (SOLQ), worth just over $5.3 million based on Wednesday's closing price. The purchase took ARK's SOLQ allocation to 799,063 shares, worth nearly $15 million.\n\nARK added the eToro and Solana staking shares to its Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), one of three funds the firm uses for a significant portion of exposure to crypto and crypto-adjacent companies, such as Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD).\n\nThe other two ETFs are Next Generation Internet (ARKW) and Innovation (ARKK).\n\nRead more: EToro Stock Surges 29% on First Day of Trading\n\nUPDATE (May 15, 13:50 UTC): Adds ARK's purchase of SOLQ shares in fourth paragraph.",
