    "summary": "The governor will present a BTC investment plan to the board Thursday, according to an interview published by the Financial Times.",
    "content": "Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl said in an interview with Financial Times (FT) that he will present a bitcoin investment plan to the board on Thursday, which, if approved, could see the apex bank diversify 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves into the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\n\n\"For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good,\" Michl said, according to an interview published by the FT and quoted by Reuters.\n\nMichl pointed to broader investor interest in the cryptocurrency since BlackRock and others debuted spot ETFs a year ago.\n\n\"An asset under consideration is Bitcoin. It currently has zero correlation to bonds and is an interesting asset for a large portfolio. Worth considering. Right now, it’s only at the stage of analysis and discussion. The Bank Board decides, and no decision is imminent. Thoughtful analysis is needed,\" Michl said in a statement on X.\n\n\"Bitcoin has significant volatility, which makes it harder to take advantage of its current low correlation with other assets. That’s why I will ask our team on Thursday to further assess Bitcoin’s potential role in our reserves. Nothing more, nothing less,\" he added.",
