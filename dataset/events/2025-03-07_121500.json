    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nWas it worth the wait? President Donald Trump finally delivered on his electoral promise on Thursday, signing an executive order to establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile.\n\nYou'd expect bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nbulls to rejoice, but the price of the largest cryptocurrency has dropped more than 2% since the news broke. The reaction is eerily similar to when the SEC approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last January. BTC initially fell 20% over the following two weeks. Still, the bulls may be back. The price rallied to an all-time high within a couple of months after the ETFs got the green light.\n\nDubbed the \"Digital Fort Knox,\" Trump's initiative provides a structured framework for bitcoin accumulation. One of the key takeaways from the order is that the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring more bitcoin without imposing extra costs on American taxpayers.\n\nThis could be achieved through various means, including selling U.S. gold reserves, liquidating other seized by the government cryptocurrencies or issuing bitcoin-bonds similar to the convertible bonds introduced by publicly traded bitcoin companies.\n\nThere's more news coming later too, specifically jobs data. Non-farm payrolls are estimated to have increased by 160,000, and the unemployment rate is seen holding at 4%.\n\nMeanwhile, broader macroeconomic uncertainty persists, including tariff-related concerns, rising global bond yields, a strengthening yen and a weakening dollar. Stay alert!\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
