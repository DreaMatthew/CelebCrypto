    "summary": "If approved, the fund would be the first exchange-traded fund tied to BNB in the U.S.",

    "content": "VanEck has filed paperwork to sell shares in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking crypto exchange Binance's blockchain.\n\nThe asset manager submitted an S-1 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday for a BNB ETF, becoming the first prospective issuer to file for such a fund in the U.S. BNB is the native token for the BNB Chain, launched in 2017 by Binance.\n\nInvestors in the fund — if approved — would also be able to earn staking rewards and additional tokens as well as other income, according to the filing. The SEC under former chair Gary Gensler had a strong opposing stance towards staking, which is why several spot ethereum\nETH\n$3,340.48\nETFs don’t include the feature.\n\nThere is, however, hope that new chair Paul Atkins will be more inclined to approve the feature for future products. Grayscale, last month, filed an amended document with the SEC to allow staking in its Ethereum ETFs and hedge fund Canary Capital recently filed a proposal to launch a Tron ETF with staking capabilities.\n\nNo decision has been made yet by the SEC on these applications, which has delayed several deadlines for crypto ETFs in recent weeks.\n\nVanEck will be expected to follow its initial filing with a 19b-4 document to make its intentions official and tie the regulator to a deadline.\n\nBNB has a market capitalization of $83.9 billion and was trading at $596 at time of publication, up about 0.27% over the past 24 hours. It is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.",
