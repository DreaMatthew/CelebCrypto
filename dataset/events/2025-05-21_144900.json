    "content": "Solana Labs' mobile team shared Wednesday that it plans to ship its Seeker phone starting Aug. 4, in addition to sharing new information about some of its infrastructure framework as well as a new token for its mobile users.\n\nThe news comes as the new iteration of Solana’s mobile, has been in the works for months, with over 150,000 units so far, according to a press release. Seeker was introduced after the phone's first model, Saga, was originally having a hard time selling, creating some uncertainty for its future. But Saga did eventually sell out after crypto users realized they could collect certain token airdrops.\n\nThe Solana Mobile team also said that in addition to the phone coming soon, it is launching the SKR token that will be integral to the Solana Mobile ecosystem. “SKR will power economy, incentives, and ownership across the ecosystem, while aligning users, developers, and hardware manufacturers towards growing the web3 mobile ecosystem,” the team wrote in the press release.\n\nAt the core of the network’s architecture is TEEPIN, the Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network, a decentralized framework consisting of three layers that will allow users, devices, and developers to interact in a secure and trustless environment.\n\n\"TEEPIN represents the next evolution in mobile — a framework where trust isn't granted by a central authority but verified through cryptography,\" said Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, in the press release.\n\nRead more: Solana Unveils Details of Second Crypto Phone 'Seeker'\n\nCORRECTION (May 21, 2025, 17:02 UTC): An earlier version of this story said that the Saga phone failed, but the phone did in fact sell out after crypto traders realized they could collect certain airdrops",
