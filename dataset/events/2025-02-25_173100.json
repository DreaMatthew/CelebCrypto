    "content": "Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi shared Tuesday that she would be leaving her position and would soon be transitioning to her new role as president at the organization.\n\nThe news comes as the nonprofit goes through a leadership shake-up and as Ethereum has become less popular for new builders in recent months, with some even blaming Miyaguchi’s leadership as for why the blockchain’s token price is lagging behind other cryptocurrencies.\n\n“This new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships, and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly,” Miyaguchi wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that supports the development of the Ethereum blockchain. Founded in 2014, Miyaguchi joined in 2018 and has been the executive sirector ever since.\n\nCoinDesk reached out to a spokesperson at the EF to find out who would fill the executive director position, but did not hear back in time for publication.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote in a post on X that “every success of the EF - the steady execution of Ethereum hard forks, client interop workshops, Devcon, Ethereum's culture and steadfast commitment to its mission and values, and more - is in part a result of Aya's stewardship.”\n\nRead more: Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Goes on Offense Amid Major Leadership Shake-up",
