    "content": "Video game retailer GameStop (GME) has purchased 4,710 bitcoin, worth nearly $513 million at the time of writing.\n\nGameStop announced the purchase on X on Wednesday but did not offer further details about when the BTC were acquired or the price paid.\n\nThe Grapevine, Texas-based company revealed its plans to pursue a bitcoin treasury strategy in March, offering $1.3 billion in debt to raise the funds for BTC acquisition.\n\nThe shares of GME rose as much as 6.6% in U.S. pre-market trading on the news, but the stock promptly dumped in early trading, falling around 10% to about $31.50. With GameStop's BTC purchase rumored to be imminent for several weeks, the GME slide may be a \"sell the news\" event.\n\nThe selloff may haver been exacerbated by a dip in BTC's price which fell from around $109,000 to around $107,300 during the ET morning.\n\nUPDATE (May 28, 15:25 UTC): Adds additional info and context on GME's price movement.",
