The contracts will be cash-settled and based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which tracks XRP’s price daily at 4:00 p.m. London time.\n\n“As innovation in the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, market participants continue to look to regulated derivatives products to manage risks across a wider range of tokens,” Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, said.\n\n“Interest in XRP and its underlying ledger (XRPL) has steadily increased as institutional and retail adoption for the network grows, and we are pleased to launch these new futures contracts to provide a capital-efficient toolset to support clients’ investment and hedging strategies.”\n\nThe move comes after CME launched Solana\nSOL\n$158.01\nfutures in March in addition to bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,998.62\nand ethereum\nETH\n$3,341.49\nfutures and options which have been trading on the exchange for a while.",
