    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nMacroeconomic factors continue to drive bitcoin's\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nshort-term price volatility as it holds steady above $80,000, with a wave of significant news emerging over the past 24 hours.\n\nStill, there's a risk-off feeling in the air as the divergence between bitcoin and the broader crypto market grows. Bitcoin dominance has surged to 62%, approaching a year-to-date high, while the ether-to-bitcoin (ETH-BTC) ratio has turned negative on a four-year compound annual basis, meaning ETH is underperforming.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s trade wars persist as another concern reining in optimism in the market. That's not just with Canada, but also in the form of metal tariffs, prompting retaliatory measures from the European Union.\n\nOne of the most intriguing developments comes from Canada, where newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney has filed to sell U.S. dollar bonds. While the size of the sale remains undisclosed, it's worth noting the country is the sixth-largest holder of U.S. Treasuries, possessing $379 billion as of the end of 2024. If the sale proceeds, it could put upward pressure on yields, which is the opposite of what Trump wants.\n\nThe Treasury yield narrative is paramount because roughly $9 trillion worth of U.S. debt is set to mature or require refinancing this year alone. This is one of the key reasons why the U.S. administration is eager to bring down Treasury yields.\n\nMore immediately, market attention is turning to today's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, with risk-asset bulls hoping for a softer inflation print. The S&P 500 is hovering around correction territory, down nearly 10%. If inflation comes in hotter than expected, risk assets could face further downside.
