    "content": "Trading platform eToro (ETOR) has expanded its crypto offerings in the U.S., adding 12 new digital assets including Dogecoin\nDOGE\n$0.1651\n, Cardano\nADA\n$0.5341\nand XRP\nXRP\n$2.2497\n, the company said Wednesday.\n\nThe additions bring the total number of cryptocurrencies available to U.S. users to 15. The new tokens also include Aave\nAAVE\n$200.57\n, Chainlink\nLINK\n$14.85\n, Compound\nCOMP\n$31.99\n, Ethereum Classic\nETC\n$14.54\n, Litecoin\nLTC\n$86.91\n, Uniswap\nUNI\n$5.1914\n, Stellar\nXLM\n$0.2745\n, Shiba Inu\nSHIB\n$0.0₅9059\n, and Yearn Finance\nYFI\n$4,433.71\n. Previously, U.S.-based users could only trade Bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,860.90\n, Bitcoin Cash\nBCH\n$487.04\nand Ethereum\nETH\n$3,331.23\non the platform.\n\nThe move is part of eToro’s push to widen its footprint in the U.S. market and to meet retail demand and match offerings from larger players like Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD).\n\nThe announcement comes just weeks after eToro made its public debut on Nasdaq, marking the first U.S. crypto firm to go public after months of trade tensions and shaky markets. Stablecoin issuer Circle, who has long had plans to go public, filed for its initial public offering on Tuesday.\n\nDespite the turbulent macro backdrop, eToro’s IPO was well-received. The company raised around $310 million, surpassing expectations and signaling investor interest in the combined stock and crypto trading platform model.\n\nShares are modestly lower on Wednesday at $64.15, but remain nicely above the IPO price of $52.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
