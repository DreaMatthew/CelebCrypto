    "content": "Ether's\nETH\n$3,495.36\nstructural decline is expected to continue, investment bank Standard Chartered (STAN) said in a research report Monday slashing its 2025 year-end price target for the world's second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nStandard Chartered said it now sees ether at $4,000 at the end of the year, down from $10,000 previously. Ether was trading around $1,903 at publication time.\n\n\"Ether is at a crossroads,\" the report said, and while it \"still dominates on several metrics,\" this dominance has been falling for some time.\n\nLayer 2 blockchains were meant to improve scalability on the Ethereum blockchain, but Standard Chartered estimates that Coinbase's (COIN) Base has reduced ether's market cap by $50 billion, and said it expects this trend to continue.\n\nMarket forces could eventually stop this structural decline, \"especially if tokenized real-world assets were to grow significantly,\" as \"ETH's security dominance means it should maintain its 80% share of this market,\" wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.\n\nStill, \"Only a proactive change of commercial direction from the Ethereum Foundation – such as taxing layer 2s – could achieve that now,\" which the bank said was unlikely.\n\nStandard Chartered said its expects the ETH/BTC ratio to decline to 0.015 by year-end 2027, the lowest level since 2017.\n\nThe bank still sees a recovery in the ether price from the current level around $1,900, as a rally in bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nis expected to lift all digital assets, but the cryptocurrency's underperformance will continue.\n\nRead more: Ether Has Underperformed, but Total Value Locked on Ethereum Is Rising: Citi",
