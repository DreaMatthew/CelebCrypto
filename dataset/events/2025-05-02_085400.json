    "content": "Tokyo-based Metaplanet (3350) has issued 3.6 billion yen (around $24.8 million) in bonds to fund additional purchases of bitcoin\nBTC\n$102,012.78\nafter the Japanese hotel firm’s holdings surpassed 5,000 BTC.\n\nAccording to a notice from the company, the newly issued bonds were sold entirely to EVO FUND. The bonds carry no interest and will be redeemed at par value on October 31, 2025, unless repaid earlier at the bondholder’s request.\n\nThe funds are earmarked specifically for BTC acquisition, in line with the plan disclosed earlier this year when Metaplanet detailed a series of stock acquisition rights.\n\nThe company expects to fund the bond's redemption through capital raised via the exercise of its stock acquisition rights, meaning the ultimate payback may rely on investor appetite for Metaplanet’s equity-linked instruments.\n\nIf proceeds from those rights exceed certain thresholds, Metaplanet reserves the right to repay portions of the bond early. Metaplanet shares closed at 428 yen each, up 8.6% in the last trading session.",
