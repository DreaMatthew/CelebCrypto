The firm has issued debt and equity to accumulate the cryptocurrency, and now has a 568,840 BTC hoard bought at an average cost of $69,287 per coin.\n\nRead more: Michael Saylor's Strategy Adds 1,895 Bitcoin, Bringing Company Stack to 555,450 BTC\n\nThe aggressive bitcoin accumulation, backed by Wall Street analysts, has made its stock sensitive not just to bitcoin’s price, but also to investor appetite for risk. Strategy’s shares are up 3,500% in the last five years to now trade at $416 a piece, giving it a $115 billion market capitalization.\n\nTo Chanos, Strategy’s valuation doesn’t make sense as MSTR shares have surged more than the price of bitcoin.\n\nThe fund manager argues that this rise reflects retail speculation more than fundamentals, a theme he believes is echoed by other firms now trying to replicate Strategy’s bitcoin accumulation strategy.\n\nRead more: '$500K Bitcoin Would Seal It': Scaramucci Says Crypto Is on the Cusp of Becoming an Asset Class",
