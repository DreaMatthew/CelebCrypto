    "content": "Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management said it plans to launch a new fund that blends bitcoin\nBTC\n$105,691.40\ngains with a fallback anchored to gold.\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald Gold Protected Bitcoin Fund, which the firm said will be its first BTC-focused investment vehicle, is structured to provide investors uncapped exposure to bitcoin's price rise while offering one-to-one downside protection based on the price of gold, according to the firm's Thursday press release.\n\nThe fund is expected to open for investors in the next few weeks, and will run for five years, the firm said.\n\n\"There are still people on the Earth that are still scared of bitcoin, and we want to bring them into this ecosystem,\" Brandon Lutnick, chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, said on stage at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. \"I think it’s going to be one of the great products of the Earth.\"\n\nThe move shows the investment giant is venturing deeper into bitcoin-related products as digital assets are becoming increasingly part of traditional markets. Earlier this week, Cantor said it opened its bitcoin lending business with first financing provided to crypto lender Maple and digital asset prime brokerage FalconX.\n\nRead more: Wall Street Giant Cantor Debuts Bitcoin Lending Business With First Tranches to FalconX, Maple",
