    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin\nBTC\n$104,850.17\nis taking a breather near $94,000, having dropped to $92,000 in the past two days. The cryptocurrency chalked out a bullish breakout above key resistance early this week, shifting focus to the $100,000 level and leaving major altcoins like XRP, ETH, SOL, ADA and DOGE behind.\n\nHowever, smaller coins like STX, SUI, ONDO and GRT put in double-digit gains in the past 24 hours, outperforming both BTC and the wider market: The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has gained about 3%.\n\nBTC's $20,000 surge since April 7 has been underpinned by increased on-chain accumulation by whales and significant inflows through spot ETFs, with the 11 U.S.-listed funds amassing almost $1.5 billion in net inflows over the past three days, according to Farside Investors.\n\nMarket gains have been bolstered by policy developments in the U.S. Late Thursday, the Federal Reserve lifted its restrictive crypto guidance, saying state member banks no longer need to provide advance notice before engaging in crypto-related activities.\n\n\"Market internals currently suggest a consolidation phase — our base case projects accumulation between $90,000 and $95,000, with potential pullbacks to $87,000, ahead of a possible breakout toward $100,000 or more in the coming weeks,\" said Valentin Fournier, the lead research analyst at BRN.\n\nQCP Capital echoed the sentiment, noting that a decisive catalyst is needed to push prices above $100,000.\n\nLater today, the University of Michigan will publish its final survey-based inflation expectations report for April. President Donald Trump's trade war has stoked Main Street inflation concerns, so the report is likely to show an increase. The market, however, likely priced in those fears early this month and is probably focusing on next week's U.S. jobs data.\n\n\"The next big chapter here will be whether all this volatility has hit real world decisions — especially in the U.S. jobs market. There is plenty of U.S. jobs data released next week and any deterioration here could trigger another round of dollar losses — albeit a more benign dollar decline on the view that the Federal Reserve would be riding to the rescue after all,\" ING said.\n\n\"In terms of Fed pricing, the market now seems comfortable to price the first cut in July — potentially once we all know whether the 90-day pause in Liberation Day tariffs is temporary or longer lasting,\" it said.
