Wednesday’s U.S. CPI inflation report, if it arrives in line with analyst forecasts of 2.9% or lower, could also boost crypto market sentiment and fuel ETH higher, the report said.\n\nEther is currently battling with key resistance at around $2,650, and a breakout could see prices climbing to the next resistance level of around $3,000, 10x Research analysts said.\n\nRead more: Ether Has Underperformed, but Total Value Locked on Ethereum Is Rising: Citi\n\nETH shed 20% of its value over the past month as the border altcoin market bled against bitcoin, which consolidated sideways in a narrow range around the $100,000 level.
