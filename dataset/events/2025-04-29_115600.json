    "content": "Bitcoin staking protocol Solv, which has over $2 billion worth of BTC locked on its platform, announced Tuesday the launch of a Shariah-compliant yield product called SolvBTC.core.\n\nThe new offering, a liquid staking token for BTC, has been developed in collaboration with the Core ecosystem, which offers a range of DeFi applications, including lending, restaking, liquid staking and decentralized exchanges.\n\nCreated with guidance from Nawa Finance and accredited by Amanie Advisors for Shariah compliance, SolvBTC.CORE generates yield by securing the Core blockchain network and engaging in on-chain DeFi activities while adhering to Islamic finance principles.\n\nSolv Protocol enables BTC holders to lend, stake, earn yields, and invest, unlocking the full potential of their coin stash. The launch of the Shariah-compliant SolvBTC.CORE means BTC holders from the Middle East can now directly participate in the Core blockchain's expanding ecosystem to generate additional yield on top of their spot holdings.\n\nRyan Chow, founder of Solv Protocol, said the Shariah-compliant product could open up new avenues for institutional investors in the Middle East.\n\n\"By aligning with both regional regulations and global financial standards, SolvBTC.CORE paves the way for sovereign wealth funds and traditional financial institutions to securely and confidently stake Bitcoin and earn real, on-chain yields. This is a significant step in accelerating the institutional adoption of digital assets in the region,\" Chow said in a press release shared with CoinDesk.\n\nShaqir Hashim, core contributor at Nawa Finance, said that BTC is the most widely held asset in markets like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Pakistan, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Malaysia, and the next thing holders are looking out for is generating an additional yield.\n\n\"The next chapter is yield. At Nawa Finance, we’re helping power that evolution by enabling ethical, values-aligned Bitcoin yield strategies that meet the compliance expectations of both institutions and communities across these regions,\" Hashim said.",
