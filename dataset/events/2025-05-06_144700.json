    "content": "Formerly known as Janover (JNVR), DeFi Development Corporation (DFDV has added an additional 82,404 solana\nSOL\n$162.61\ntokens to its treasury, pushing its total holdings to 400,091 SOL.\n\nAt SOL's current price of $143, the company stack is worth more than $57 million.\n\nThe newly acquired tokens include locked SOL, purchased through BitGo’s over-the-counter desk, according to a press release. These tokens can’t be moved on-chain until unlocked, but they can still be traded over-the-counter between institutions, the firm said.\n\nThe company said it plans to stake these assets to generate yield.\n\nThe accumulation follows the acquisition of a validator operation earlier this week, which it will use to self-stake its entire SOL treasury and generate “protocol-native cashflow.”\n\nDFDV shares are lower by 3.8% in Tuesday morning trade alongside SOL's 2% price decline.",
