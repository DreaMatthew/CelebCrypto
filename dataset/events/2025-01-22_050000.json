    "content": "A significant SOL options block trade crossed the tape on Deribit via the OTC network Paradigm late Monday, suggesting expectations for a price rally to $400 by the end of February.\n\nThe trade, structured as a bull call spread, involved a long position in the $280 call and a simultaneous short position in the $400 call, with 10,000 contracts for each leg and both legs set to expire on Feb. 28, according to block flows tracked by Amberdata. The block trade, considered a proxy for institutional activity, is consistent with forecasts for SOL outperformance under Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nA bull call spread achieves its maximum profit when the underlying asset's price is at or above the short call's strike price, which is $400 in this case, which means the buyer expecting prices to surge 55% from the going market rate of $257 in just over a month. The buyer is betting that the spread will move past $280, reaching up to $400 with a breakeven around $300, according to Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, Greg Magadini.",
