    "content": "Right now, my X feed is full of people who are giving up on Web3 gaming. I get it. Over $12 billion of venture capital funding has gone into it since 2020 and they haven’t seen the sort of breakout success that many expected. Even the best games haven’t reached anything close to mainstream scale. Token prices are down. Studios are shutting down. And everyone is exhausted.\n\nBut measuring Web3 gaming by token prices alone is like calling the internet a failure because of the dot-com crash — it ignores how far the technology has come and where it's headed. It’s missing the real story.\n\nAt its core, Web3 gaming is about giving players real ownership — not just of the in-game items that they buy and earn, but also their identities and achievements. In traditional games, players invest time, effort and money into digital assets that ultimately belong to the publisher. Web3 changes that. By putting assets on-chain, players can truly own what they earn—whether that’s tradable items like weapons or land, or non-transferable badges of reputation, guild history, or verifiable skill. It’s not just about buying and selling stuff — it’s about agency, persistence, and getting proper recognition for what you’ve built and what is really yours in the ecosystem.\n\nThe concept isn’t new. Players have wanted more control over their in-game assets for years. Look at the massive markets for CS:GO skins or World of Warcraft gold. But until now, those economies have been fragmented, restricted, or at risk of being shut down if a centralized publisher decides to shut it down or change the rules. Web3 makes these economies open, interoperable, player-owned and player-driven.\n\nOwnership has always been the foundation of Web3 gaming, and play-to-earn was an experimental model that showed the potential for open and permissionless virtual economies on blockchain. Now, the industry is evolving with a stronger focus on sustainable economies and better tokenomics, deeper gameplay, and long-term player engagement.\n\nBut if you’re comparing Web3 gaming to Web2 gaming, you’ll be disappointed. Traditional gaming has had decades to fine-tune game design, build massive player bases, and develop business models that work, while Web3 gaming is still in its experimental phase. Sure, billions of dollars of investment can speed things up, but throwing money at a brand new category doesn’t magically buy it a track record or instantly create new games that people love.\n\nI’ve been making games for over 20 years and I have seen every major shift get dismissed before it took over. Nobody believed mobile gaming could compete with PCs or consoles until it became bigger than both. Free-to-play was called a scam until it made more money and reached more players than ever before. Esports was a joke until stadiums sold out and prize pools hit millions. Digital skins were “worthless” before they became a multi-billion dollar market.\n\nAnd now, Web3 gaming is at that same inflection point.\n\nWhen I first heard about blockchain in 2018, everyone I knew in FinTech was talking about it. So of course I thought it was boring and I ignored it. It wasn’t until I learned about CryptoKitties that I actually took notice. When I saw people collecting, trading and actually owning these cute on-chain cats, that’s when I got excited because I knew they weren't like other in-game assets. CryptoKitties were digital things that no one could take away from you. As someone who’s spent their life grinding in games, and their career convincing others to grind the same — without really getting anything for it — that idea of digital ownership gave me a whole new way to think.\n\nSo I went all-in on blockchain games. But 2018 and 2019 were really tough times. Pretty much no one else cared back then. There was no support, no real funding, no clear idea of what these games could be beyond speculation, and (outside of a handful of believers) there was very little conviction. The market was in a deep bear cycle, and many teams either gave up or ran out of money before they could launch. Still, some of us kept building. We stayed lean, experimented, and learned everything the hard way. It feels similarly bad now, but not as bad as it was then. Looking back, I’m so glad we didn’t pack it in when success was just around the corner.\n\nWhen Axie Infinity broke through in 2021, everything changed. Web3 founders like Jeffrey “Jihoz” Zirlin of Sky Mavis, Yat Siu of Animoca Brands, Sebastien Borget of The Sandbox, and me, went from being called crazy to visionary overnight. Suddenly, we were speaking on the main stage at conferences where we used to watch in the audience. We made news headlines and “Most Influential” lists. Investors who ignored our emails were asking how much they could put in. My email inbox filled up with fundraising decks pitching the next YGG.\n\nThen in 2022, the market crashed, and just as quickly, we went back to being crazy. But that never really bothered me because crazy people are the ones who make big things happen.\n\nNow, everyone’s asking: When is the next big Web3 game? The answer is this: good games take time. And if you look past the red candles to take notice of what exists already today, you’ll see we how much progress we’ve made since our industry was seeded in 2018:\n\nThese are just a few examples, but they show the kind of traction we’re seeing: better infrastructure, growing communities, more sustainable virtual economies, digital ownership.\n\nThose who FUD Web3 gaming today don’t understand it. They missed CryptoKitties in 2018, Axie in 2020, YGG in 2021, and they’ll miss the next wave too because they’re measuring the wrong metrics. Web3 is growing and innovating faster than any other sector in gaming. It’s not time to quit. It's time to double down. Let them call us whatever they want: crazy, delusional. Visionary, pioneering. It doesn’t change what we do. We’ve been here before. Stay the path.",
