This yield metric reflects the company’s effective increase in bitcoin per share held.\n\nNotably, BTC Yield is a proprietary KPI Metaplanet uses to track treasury performance. It isolates gains driven purely by bitcoin acquisition strategies while neutralizing dilution from newly issued shares. In Q1 2025 alone, the company saw a yield of 95.6%.\n\nShares of Metaplanet were trading 5% lower at the time of writing.\n\nDisclaimer: This article, or parts of it, was generated with assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
