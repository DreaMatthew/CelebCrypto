That makes traditional financial tracking and intercepting methods largely obsolete, which explains why criminals love cryptocurrency.\n\nEarlier this year, a media outlet linked to the Islamic State (ISIS) Pakistan Province reportedly published a poster calling for contributions of \"jihad with wealth\" and sought donations in monero.\n\nStill, prices for the controversial coin have risen over 100% to above $400 this year, hitting levels last seen in early 2021, CoinDesk data show. The rally has been supposedly led by optimism about the impending privacy upgrade and rumors of re-listing by major exchanges, including the U.S.-listed Coinbase.\n\nMeanwhile,\nLTC\n$86.89\n, considered silver to bitcoin's gold, has dropped 6% this year to trade below $100. Toncoin, which is deeply integrated into the social messaging app Telegram's economy, has dropped 25% this year.",
