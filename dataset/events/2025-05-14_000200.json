The listing values the company at $4.2 billion.\n\nThe price is significantly higher than the marketed range, as the company received a much higher demand than previously anticipated.\n\nEToro becomes the first U.S. crypto company to go public after a rough couple of months with President Donald Trump in discussions to make several tariff deals with world leaders.\n\nDue to the uncertainty, many companies, including eToro, had delayed going public.
