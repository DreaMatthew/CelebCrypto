    "content": "Animoca Brands' most recent year-end financial report shows a shift in the company's focus, with the web3 giant run reporting that its Digital Assets Advisory has edged out its traditional revenue source.\n\nThe firm's advisory unit generated $165 million in 2024, a 116% year-over-year increase. According to a release, this division provides web3 projects with token advisory, tokenomics, marketing, listing advisory, node operation, and trading services.\n\nAnimoca said it generated $110 million in bookings from web3 businesses – its traditional territory of gaming and NFTs – while $39 million came from investment gains and venture management fees.\n\nThis change in its web3 business reflects an approximately 40% year-over-year drop from the $182 million it reported last year.\n\nOverall, the company looks to have strengthened its balance sheet in 2024, holding $293 million in cash and stablecoins, $538 million in digital assets, and $2.9 billion in off-balance-sheet token reserves.\n\nIts minority investments totaled $564 million across 540 companies, reflecting a 67% increase in cash reserves and a 165% rise in digital asset holdings.\n\nWhile the number of portfolio investments increased to 540 from 450 noted, Animoca’s private investment holdings dropped 18%, falling from $690 million to $564 million, due to token unlocks, equity exits, and asset write-downs weighed on valuations.\n\nLate last year, Animoca opened a large new office in Hong Kong – bucking a trend in the city that saw TradFi firms downsizing and reducing headcount as well as square footage.",
