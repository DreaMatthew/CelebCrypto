    "summary": "The mailing list was unavailable for a short period on Wednesday and was placed in a “banned content warning” cohort on Google.",
    "content": "The Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a key communication platform for developers of the original blockchain, was briefly offline on Wednesday after an apparent bot attack.\n\nGoogle flagged the publicly viewable group as containing “spam, malware, or other malicious content.” Users accessing the group received a “permanently removed” message while the issue was being sorted out.\n\nThe active group is used to discuss Bitcoin proposals, relay development messages, and flag and solve any issues across the Bitcoin ecosystem. It moved to Google in February 2024. Its previous hosts were the Linux Foundation, Oregon State University Open Source Lab’s infrastructure and SourceForge.net.\n\n“Apparently we're \"permanently removed\". Our transgression? We're \"unwanted content,” developer Ruben Somsen posted on X. “Really Google? Open source development is \"unwanted\"?”\n\nGoogle’s Workspace Support resolved the issue early Thursday, according to an X post. It did not provide a clear reason for the removal.\n\nReports suggested the takedown could have been due to a bot attack, where a malicious actor performs an extremely high number of tasks (such as clicks or visits) to disable a service and create havoc within a specific environment.\n\nThe intrusion comes as the bitcoin (BTC) price grapples with high volatility amid a shaky macroeconomic environment, stemming from a slew of U.S. tariffs announced Wednesday.",
