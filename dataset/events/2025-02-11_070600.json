    "summary": "There’s a 90% chance Litecoin ETFs are approved, followed by 75% odds for a dogecoin ETF.",
    "content": "Odds of a\nLTC\n$87.07\nexchange-traded fund (ETF) going live in the coming months jumped to over 90% with\nDOGE\n$0.1655\nnext at 75% odds, well-followed ETF analyst James Seyffart said in an X post late Monday.\n\nSeyffart made similar predictions for bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,918.17\nETFs before the products went live in 2024. Several providers have filed ETFs for various major tokens in the past year under the Biden administration to low interest from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nLTC is up 15% in the past 24 hours, beating a 2% increase in bitcoin\nBTC\n$103,918.17\n, with DOGE up 6%.\n\nA shifting regulatory climate has buoyed approval hopes, however, with the SEC already passing initial checks for certain tokens in the past weeks.\n\n“We're putting out relatively high odds of approval across the board. Mainly focused on Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin for now,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Seyffart said. “Big implications/expectations in these odds are that Filings will be acknowledged. Likely this week for XRP and Dogecoin.”\n\n“The odds for everything on this list --Aside from maybe Litecoin-- would have been VERY very low if Dems were still in control,” Seyffart added. Prospective litecoin ETFs could see inflows of up to $580 million if investors adopt them at the same rate as the bitcoin ETFs, as CoinDesk previously reported.\n\nNEW: @EricBalchunas and I took a look at the filings for spot crypto ETFs. We're putting out relatively high odds of approval across the board. Mainly focused on Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin for now.\n\nHere's the table with the odds and some other details: pic.twitter.com/xaXaNXLb0M\n\nOdds given by the analyst XRP and SOL products are under 70% as of Tuesday. Headwinds for XRP products come from a chance of possible appeals of the now-settled SEC’s case against related company Ripple Labs.",
