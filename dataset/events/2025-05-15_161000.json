    "content": "The daughter and grandson of a French crypto exchange CEO were targeted in a failed kidnap attempt, adding to the growing number of crypto-related kidnapping cases in the country, France 24 reported on Tuesday.\n\nA video widely shared on social media showed the attempt, in which three masked men wrestled the woman and another person to the ground in Paris. A shop owner intervened, waving a fire extinguisher, and the attackers gave up, driving off in two waiting vans. France 24 identified the crypto exchange as Paymium.\n\nThe attack follows earlier — successful — kidnappings in the country. In January, David Ballard, a co-founder of crypto-wallet developer Ledger, was ransomed after being kidnapped with his wife from their home. In May, the father of a French crypto millionaire was kidnapped and rescued days later. Four suspects were arrested at the time, the BBC reported. Both of the men had a finger chopped off.\n\nInterior Minister Bruno Retailleau said on Wednesday he plans to meet with French crypto entrepreneurs to discuss how to protect them following the surge of kidnappers targeting wealthy people with crypto ties in France. The Paris prosecutors office opened an investigation into the attack, Reuters reported.\n\n\"These units within the law enforcement agencies have actually been very successful holding some of those people to account in those kidnapping cases,\" Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin said at Consensus on Wednesday in response to a question on the worldwide kidnapping for ransom trend. \"I think that the message needs to get out there that these payments are traceable.\"",
