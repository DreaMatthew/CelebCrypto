    "content": "There’s a science to issuing a token.\n\nAt least that’s according to Shane Molidor, the founder of Forgd, a platform that specializes in advising crypto projects on how to launch their own native tokens.\n\n“It's easier now to launch a token than ever, especially with pump.fun,” Molidor told CoinDesk in an interview, referring to the Solana-based launch platform favored by memecoin creators. “But it's harder now than ever to launch a utility token that actually ends up performing well, because there's a finite amount of attention among retail and institutional investors.”\n\n“At the end of the day, everyone seeks a positive return on investment, but if there's a finite pool of capital, you've got a lot of churn,” Molidor added.\n\nForgd provides free-to-use software for blockchain projects to design tokenomics, engage market makers, navigate exchange listings, and underwrite their own valuation at launch.\n\nOnce they officially launch their token, these projects can keep using Forgd as a data analytics platform to track their market makers, monitor unlocks, and optimize token demand drivers.\n\nThe company also has an internal advisory practice to help guide large projects to fruition. More recently, Forgd has built out a portal where other token advisory firms can manage their portfolio; additionally, market makers are able to access transparent deal flow, as well as track uptime obligations.\n\nThe software has been used by more than 1,500 projects, according to Molidor, about half of which have been research-oriented, meaning users played around with the tools to understand how it all works.\n\nMost of the time, the more serious projects (which Molidor called “blue chips”) end up using the software while still working with an advisory firm — which could be Forgd itself, or one of its competitors.\n\nIn Molidor’s book, to qualify as a “blue chip project” means raising significant funding from venture capitalists and offering their token at about $100 million notional or above on major centralized exchanges. Multiple tokens now in the Top 100 in terms of market capitalization have been launched through Forgd, Molidor stated, though he declined to provide any names.\n\n“The goal is to provide transparency and standardize this process of go-to-market,” Molidor said. “It's always struck me as odd that… protocol innovators are expected to become subject matter experts in all things market microstructure.”\n\n“A lot of the intricacies of this go-to-market process are very much a black box to all but insiders. I used to be one of those insiders, so I know how to navigate the process,” he added.\n\nForgd’s recommendations are completely data-driven, according to Molidor. For tokenomics, for example, the firm will look at all the projects that launched recently, identify those that performed well, and analyze things such as token distribution, token emissions, their valuation on launch day, price performance, market capitalization, trading volume, and so on.\n\nThe analysis also covers market makers — which ones were used, what was their percentage of the total order book, what was the contribution in terms of making or filling orders, the tightness of spreads, et cetera. That way, when a project wants to launch with Forgd, it’s able to see a given market maker’s historical performance before inking a deal with them.\n\nObviously, markets change all of the time, and what may have worked for a specific project in the fall of 2024 may not work anymore in summer of 2025. But Forgd takes great care in updating its database with every new major launch that goes live.\n\nForgd mostly works with crypto native firms, though Molidor said the firm has had conversations with major, sophisticated institutions interested in learning about the process of launching a token.\n\nIn Molidor’s saying, the current process for launching tokens — with assets trading at multi-billion dollar fully diluted valuations shortly after launch, and with hyperinflationary token emissions over a period of three or four years — is completely unsustainable and needs to change. With such projects, demand is usually limited to the opening days or weeks; afterwards, the investing public’s attention moves on to other projects.\n\n“The reality is that, behind the scenes, on big time launches, the opening price and the magnitude of the… pop are hyper manufactured, either by the exchange or market makers, so the project might have very minimal influence as to how high they're trading in the first one minute. Predatory or self-interested actors might influence that,” Molidor said.\n\n“What I think is actually more common is that the project doesn't know how to structure a balanced relationship with strategic partners like market makers, and they unknowingly put themselves in a position where the market maker is incentivized to let the price rip,” he added.\n\nThe problem could be fixed if mechanisms were put in place to ensure sustained demand in the secondary market, Molidor said. In traditional markets, when a company goes public, it has certain assurances in the book building process from the underwriter that there will be institutional demand, he claimed. Tokens, however, usually can only count on retail speculative demand once they go to market.\n\nTo remedy that, deal structures could be conducted in such a way that, if an institution wants to invest in the primary market, they are only allowed to invest a small portion of the capital they want to allocate — with the rest earmarked for the secondary market.\n\n“Just as DeFi summer revolutionized the way that we think about liquidity provision, I wouldn't be surprised if we see on-chain mechanisms that incentivize buy-side demand being injected on-chain after a token is launched, that could be with basically yield that's generated in tokens, or maybe stablecoins that effectively lower the cost basis of institutions,” Molidor said.",
