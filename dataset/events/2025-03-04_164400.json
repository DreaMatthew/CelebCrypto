    "content": "The United States is undisputedly the leader of global innovation. From technology, to agriculture, to finance, we stand alone.\n\nWe have retained this position not because we force innovators to adopt our values, but because we allow entrepreneurs, who hold these values, to build in the United States free from government interference and excessive regulations. These aren’t Republican or Democrat ideals – they’re American ones.\n\nNowhere is this more apparent than in cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency empowers individuals to take ownership of their financial futures. It enables economic freedom, ensuring that all Americans – regardless of their background – have access to the tools they need to be successful. Crypto has the potential to shift the power from the centralized institutions that control much of our financial system back into the hands of the American people.\n\nThe power this technology represents is bigger than any one party. With that in mind, we have announced the creation of the Congressional Crypto Caucus, a nonpartisan group of members of Congress united by the promise this technology holds who aim to work as a voting bloc in Congress.\n\nAs we have done together for years, the Crypto Caucus will bring together members from across the country and across the political spectrum who are unified and committed to our mission. Together, we’ll focus on ushering key policy proposals through Congress and building coalitions within the crypto community.\n\nThe Crypto Caucus’s mission goes beyond a platform to discuss policy. We are committed to delivering tangible results for the American people. When important votes or issues arise, our caucus will be prepared to act.\n\nAs the chairmen of the caucus, we’ll work with our members to advance a principled policy agenda grounded in an understanding of the unique decentralized nature of digital asset technology. We are committed to fostering an economic environment where open, permissionless, and private innovation can thrive, and where attempts for centralized control are quashed. Our caucus will promote policies that allow every American the chance to participate in the digital economy.\n\nAs more and more Americans access the digital economy, we will work to support policy initiatives that strike a balance between consumer protection and innovation. Our focus will be to advocate for transparent, commonsense regulations that safeguard consumers, enhance financial literacy, and expand access to these cutting-edge financial tools. By achieving this balance, our caucus will help enable millions of Americans to access these financial tools safely, while promoting policies that support innovation in the United States.\n\nFor far too long, innovators have struggled to navigate the regulatory minefield in the United States. As we begin our work with this new caucus, we aim to champion a balanced framework that provides legal clarity while fostering an environment where American ingenuity can flourish. We do not call for deregulation, but for smart regulation – rules that protect consumers without pushing the entrepreneurs they rely on overseas.\n\nAs countries around the world adopt policies that embrace the promise of crypto technology, the United States cannot risk falling behind. We seek to work with the whole-of-government approach to digital asset policymaking to unlock the future of open, permissionless, and private innovation in the United States. Our caucus strives to support policies that guarantee the United States remains the best place in the world to build, invest, and innovate in the digital asset space.\n\nThis is an important moment for the United States. This revolutionary technology represents a fundamental shift in how we think about finance. As leaders of the Congressional Crypto Caucus, we invite our colleagues to join us in seizing this opportunity. Together, as a nonpartisan coalition, we will ensure the United States doesn’t just participate in the future of finance but defines it.",
