    "title": "Coinbase a Buying Opportunity After Three-Week 30% Plunge: Rosenblatt",

    "author": "Helene Braun",
    "summary": "Analyst Chris Brendler sees 45% upside in shares of the crypto exchange.",
    "content": "Along with stocks in general and crypto markets in particular, it's been a rough few weeks for Coinbase (COIN), its shares sporting a decline of about 30% since mid-February and a 40% drop since hitting a 52-week high in early December.\n\nInvestment firm Rosenblatt spies opportunity, saying investors will benefit from buying the dip as the exchange remains set to profit from the Trump administration's pro-crypto stance.\n\n“COIN is the clear blue chip in the sector and should be a beneficiary of multiple positive tailwinds,” Rosenblatt analyst Chris Brendler wrote, initiating coverage of the crypto exchange with a buy rating and $305 price target. \"COIN has also proven its ability to navigate both Bull and Bear markets and with the growth in non-trading revenue, we believe the stock will prove more resilient in the next Crypto Winter.\"\n\n“Fortunately, we think it is more of a 'Crypto Spring' right now and like the stock here after the pullback,” he added.\n\nBrendler attributes COIN's recent declines as a result of on-again, off-again tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump in addition to broader political uncertainty, which have sent risk markets lower across the board of late.\n\nCOIN nevertheless, reminds Brendler, remains a dominant player in the industry thanks to its strong brand, deep liquidity, and superior user experience.\n\n“Regulatory clarity will attract more TradFi players into crypto, but COIN’s decade-plus head start and comprehensive product suite position it to maintain market leadership,\" he added.\n\nAlongside another difficult day in markets, COIN is lower by 1% to $211 on Friday. The Nasdaq is down 1.4%, the S&P 500 lower by 1.1% and bitcoin is off 3.5% to $87,000.",
