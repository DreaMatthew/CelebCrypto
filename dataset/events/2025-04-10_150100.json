BNB's recent price action, featuring a 13.2% trading range, highlights the heightened volatility affecting digital assets.\n\nTechnical analysis reveals key support around $540-$545 and resistance at $565-$570, with trading volumes spiking during both selloffs and recovery phases, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data.\n\nThe implementation of new tariffs under President Trump's administration has created a ripple effect across financial markets.
