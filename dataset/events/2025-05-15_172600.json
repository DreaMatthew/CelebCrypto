    "content": "The cryptocurrency market is experiencing significant fluctuations as global economic factors and regulatory developments create both challenges and opportunities. Litecoin's recent price action reflects this broader market sentiment, with the cryptocurrency encountering strong resistance at $101.65 after reaching a peak of $101.90. Despite the subsequent correction to the $95-$96 range, LTC has shown resilience with support emerging around $95.82.\n\nMarket analysts point to the recent US-China tariff agreement as a key driver behind Litecoin's price movements, with the cryptocurrency gaining bullish momentum following the deal announcement. Additionally, Federal Reserve policy decisions have contributed to positive sentiment in risk assets, helping LTC maintain its position above critical support levels despite the correction.\n\nIn the regulatory landscape, the SEC has delayed decisions on spot ETF applications for several cryptocurrencies including Litecoin, creating uncertainty but also anticipation. Despite these delays, betting markets show ~80% probability for approval before year-end, suggesting continued optimism among investors. This regulatory environment, combined with increasing institutional adoption and cross-border transaction utility, positions Litecoin as a significant player in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThis technical analysis was conducted according to CoinDesk s research model analysing CoinDesk Data",
