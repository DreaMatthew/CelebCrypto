Learn more.\n\nIn today’s Crypto for Advisors, Tedd Strazimiri from Evolve ETFs writes about the evolution of tokenization and the value it brings to investors.\n\nThen, Peter Gaffney from Inveniam answers questions about what tokenization can do for wealth managers and their clients in Ask an Expert.\n\n- Sarah Morton\n\nThe tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) has moved beyond buzzword status to become a multi-billion-dollar reality, led by Ethereum. Of the more than $250 billion in tokenized assets, Ethereum commands approximately 55% of the market. From stablecoins and U.S. Treasuries to real estate, private credit, commodities and equities, Ethereum has emerged as the preferred blockchain infrastructure for institutions aiming to bridge traditional finance with the digital asset world.\n\nWhy tokenization matters\n\nAt its core, tokenization is the process of converting ownership rights in RWAs into digital tokens that live on a blockchain. This transformation introduces unprecedented efficiencies in settlement speed, liquidity and accessibility. Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7, settled instantly and fractionalized to reach a broader range of investors. For institutions, tokenization reduces costs tied to custody, middlemen and manual processes, while offering transparency and programmability.\n\nBut while tokenization is a trend that can take root across multiple blockchains, Ethereum’s dominance is no accident. Its established infrastructure, widespread developer ecosystem and proven security have made it the go-to platform for major players entering the space.\n\nRanked: Blockchain Networks Supporting RWA Tokenization\n\nBlackRock’s BUIDL and the rise of institutional tokenization\n\nOne of the best examples of institutional adoption of tokenization is BlackRock’s BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. Treasury fund built on Ethereum. Launched in early 2024, BUIDL allows investors to access U.S. Treasuries via blockchain, offering real-time settlement and transparency into holdings. The fund has rapidly scaled to over $2.5 billion in assets under management, securing a 41% market share in the tokenized U.S. Treasury space. Ethereum remains the dominant chain for tokenized Treasuries, accounting for 74% of the $6.2 billion tokenized US treasuries market. BUIDL isn’t just a product; it’s a signal that TradFi sees Ethereum as the backbone of the next financial era.\n\nStablecoins: the foundation layer\n\nNo discussion of tokenization is complete without stablecoins. U.S. dollar-pegged assets like USDC and USDT represent the vast majority (95%) of all tokenized assets. Stablecoins alone account for more than $128 billion of Ethereum’s tokenized economy1 and serve as the primary medium of exchange across DeFi, cross-border settlements and remittance platforms.\n\nIn many developing economies, like Nigeria or Venezuela, stablecoins provide access to the U.S. dollar without needing a bank. Whether shielding savings from inflation or enabling seamless international trade, stablecoins show the real-world value of tokenized dollars, backstopped by the Ethereum network.\n\nTokenized Stocks and beyond\n\nTokenized stocks on Ethereum represent a growing but still nascent segment of the tokenized asset space. These digital assets mirror the price of real-world equities and ETFs, offering 24/7 trading, fractional ownership, global accessibility and instant settlement. Key benefits include increased liquidity, lower transaction costs and democratized access to markets traditionally limited by geography or account type. Popular tokenized stocks include Nvidia, Coinbase and MicroStrategy, as well as ETFs like SPY. As regulatory clarity improves, tokenized equities on Ethereum could reshape how investors access and trade stocks, especially in underserved or emerging markets.\n\nAdditionally, real estate, private credit, commodities and even art are finding their way onto Ethereum in tokenized formats, proving the chain’s adaptability for diverse asset classes.\n\nTokenized RWAs (excluding Stablecoins)\n\nSource: RWA.xyz, as of April 22, 2025.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthereum’s dominance in tokenized assets isn’t just about being first — it’s about being built for permanence. As the infrastructure underpinning real-world asset tokenization matures, Ethereum’s role as the financial layer of the internet becomes more pronounced. While newer chains like Solana will carve out niches in the space, Ethereum continues to be the platform where regulation meets innovation, and where finance finds its next form.\n\n- Tedd Strazimiri, product research associate, Evolve ETFs\n\nQ. What are the value drivers of tokenization for a wealth manager?\n\nA. The tokenization of assets should come with newfound utility. Financial advisors, wealth managers and other fiduciaries already have access to a wide universe of investment products. Where tokenization adds value is through the infrastructure emerging around tokenized real-world assets, particularly applications enabling the collateralization and margining of asset-backed tokens.\n\nBlockchain-based data management systems, like Inveniam, are designed to enable real-time, asset-level reporting to facilitate private asset-backed stablecoin loans, with the same integrity and traceability that exists elsewhere in the crypto space. This allows legacy private asset classes — like real estate and credit — to function similarly to how $30 billion in crypto loans are currently collateralized on platforms like Aave. This new utility is a significant value-add and a differentiating service factor that advisors can offer clients beyond traditional crypto allocations.\n\nQ. How does tokenization help advisors achieve their portfolio management goals?\n\nA. Alongside benefits like collateralization, advisors also gain greater control over client portfolio allocations through second-order tokenization benefits. Many investment funds across private equity, hedge funds, private credit and commercial real estate have high minimum investment requirements and illiquid secondary trading activity. This “set it and forget it” mentality leads to inefficient portfolio management, in which advisors either overallocate or underallocate due to the “lumpiness” of the underlying asset.\n\nBy contrast, tokenized funds can be fractionalized far more efficiently than existing offerings, meaning advisors can buy in at much lower minimums, such as $10,000 increments, versus millions of dollars at a time. Then as client preferences, positions and portfolios shift, advisors can reallocate accordingly, making use of secondary liquidity venues and ongoing low-minimum subscriptions. This improves an advisor’s ability to meet client demands and achieve return targets without being inhibited by outdated practices.\n\n- Peter Gaffney, director of DeFi & digital trading, Inveniam",
