Chipper Cash, which boasts five million customers across nine African countries, said the move will allow consumers to speedily receive funds from around the world, around the clock - a process that's otherwise expensive and cumbersome for users.\n\n“Our partnership with Chipper Cash marks a key milestone in the expansion of Ripple’s business in Africa,\" said Reece Merrick, Managing Director, Middle East and Africa, at Ripple, in a prepared statement. \"Consumers and businesses across the continent are increasingly recognizing the potential of blockchain technology, and we are excited to bring our crypto-enabled payments solution to our partners in the region,”\n\nRipple’s partnership with Chipper Cash builds on its growing presence in Africa, which began with a collaboration with Onafriq, a payments network connecting African markets, in 2023.\n\nXRP prices are down 4.5% in the past 24 hours alongside a market-wide drop.",
