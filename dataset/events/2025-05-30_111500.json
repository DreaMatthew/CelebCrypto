    "content": "By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nCryptocurrency markets fell Friday as renewed concerns over U.S. trade policy unsettled traditional markets and outweighed news that otherwise might be seen as positive for the industry.\n\nThe CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index, a measure of the broad crypto market, fell 4.4% to 3,129 in the past 24 hours. And while bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nslipped 2.8% to around $105,300, it's worth keeping in mind the largest cryptocurrency has held above $100,000 for more than 20 consecutive days in a sign of persistent investor demand.\n\nThe sell-off came as a U.S. appeals court reinstated trade tariffs blocked by a lower court, which had ruled them illegal. The reversal reignited concerns of an extended trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview, noted that negotiations with China were “a bit stalled,” compounding the uncertainty.\n\n“When it comes to global trade right now, the only certainty is uncertainty,” said Darren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown in an emailed statement. Adding to the macroeconomic maelstrom, Trump reportedly pushed Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates during an in-person meeting at the White House.\n\nBitcoin’s attraction has been clear during the uncertainty. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is at record-low volatility and drawing in billions from investors. Spot bitcoin ETFs have seen $5.85 billion in total net flows this month, up from $2.97 billion in April, according to SoSoVale data.\n\nAdding to the momentum, Spanish banking giant Santander is reportedly considering offering retail clients access to cryptocurrencies, while Panama proposed that ships pay transit fees in its canal in BTC.\n\nAll eyes now turn to core PCE inflation data, a key gauge for Fed policy. A hot reading later this morning could dash hopes for rate cuts, potentially weighing on risk assets further.\n\n“Any sign of worsening inflationary pressure is likely to weigh on expectations for further interest cuts by the Fed this year, which would be a worry given the inertia building in the economy,” Hargreaves Lansdown’s head of equity research wrote. Still, \"the numbers need to be taken with a large pinch of salt, given that they’re yet to feel the full impact of tariffs.\"\n\nFor now, bitcoin’s ability to hold the psychological $100,000 line remains a key landmark amid the uncertainty.
