    "content": "Strategic allocation away from U.S. assets by investors could see bitcoin hit a new all-time high in the second quarter of the year, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick said in a report Monday.\n\nKendrick sees the world's largest cryptocurrency as reaching $120,000 this quarter as he reiterated his previous target of $200,000 by the end of 2025.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $95,300 at publication time.\n\nKendrick noted that the U.S. Treasury term premium, which is closely correlated to the bitcoin price, is at a 12-year high. Accumulation by whales has also been strong. In addition, bitcoin time-of-day analysis suggests that American investors may be looking for non-U.S. assets, he said.\n\nLastly, exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows in the last week suggest \"safe-haven reallocation from gold into BTC,\" wrote Kendrick.\n\n\"Bitcoin may be a better hedge than gold against financial system risks,\" he added.\n\nRead more: Tariffs, Trade Tensions May Be Positive for Bitcoin Adoption in Medium Term: Grayscale",
