    "summary": "AI tokens, including NEAR, ICP, TAO and RENDER rose on Tuesday after OpenAI announced the closing of its record-breaking private funding round the day prior.",
    "content": "CoreWeave (CRWV) shares rose more than 38% on their third day of trading debut after raising nearly $1.5 billion from its IPO following OpenAi's announcement of a record-breaking $40 billion funding round on Monday.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) startup went public on the Nasdaq exchange on Friday afternoon. The stock dropped below its IPO price to $39 and ended the day flat at $40 before dropping another 10% on Monday, its first full day of trading. CoreWeave’s IPO came at a time of strong anxiety and uncertainty in global markets, diminishing investor appetite and risk tolerance.\n\nHowever, investor sentiment towards AI-related stocks seemed to have changed on Tuesday after AI powerhouse OpenAI announced on Monday that it had closed a $40 billion funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion. The move appears to have assured investors that there continues to be a strong appetite for AI companies, even in the current rough market.\n\nThis positive outlook has also spread to digital assets, as AI-related tokens were boosted on Tuesday. AI tokens, including Near Protocol\nNEAR\n$1.8865\n,\nICP\n$5.1454\n,\nTAO\n$418.44\nand Render (RENDER), were all up over 3% on Tuesday, with RENDER leading the group, trading 7.4% higher. The broader digital assets market, CoinDesk20 Index, also rose 3%.\n\nMeanwhile, the shares of Core Scientific (CORZ), the bitcoin miner and data center with a large partnership with CoreWeave, have also risen more than 9% on Tuesday.",
