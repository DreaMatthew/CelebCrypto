    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nBitcoin is building momentum, rising over 2% on the day to over $84,000, with memecoins leading the market higher, followed by tokens associated with artificial intelligence and gaming. In traditional markets, gold set another record, surpassing $3,140, and futures linked to major U.S. equity indices are pointing to a positive open.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pledged a \"very kind\" yet firm approach toward all trading partners ahead of Wednesday's planned reciprocal tariffs announcement.\n\nStill, market flows reveal nervousness likely stemming from tariff uncertainty. An aggressive move could ratchet up inflation expectations, which would lower risk asset prices, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nReports suggest that the Treasury and other federal agencies are expected to disclose their holdings of bitcoin and other tokens on April 5, That's in accordance with the March 11 document that called for such an action within 30 days of Trump's March 6 decision to issue an executive order to form a strategic crypto reserve.\n\nStill, some indicators call for caution. For instance, bitcoin's one-year percentage change is approaching the negative zone, according to crypto research firm Alphractal. \"Out of the four times this has happened, three led to bearish movements, while one had no significant effect,\" the firm said.\n\nBTC's apparent demand by 30-day change, derived from the flow of coins into exchanges and adjusted for factors including net outflows, now shows the most negative values in over a year, according to data source CryptoQuant.\n\nSpeaking of the broader market, decentralized AI data liquidity network Vana unveiled the VRC-20 data token standard for fair and transparent data token transactions. \"For data markets to work, tokens must be reliable, secure, and useful. As a universal standard for data-backed tokens, VRC-20 delivers this by ensuring fair and transparent data token trading,\" Vana said on X.\n\nElsewhere, the MOVE Index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility for the U.S. Treasury notes, is rising. A volatile Treasury market often causes financial tightening worldwide, leading to reduced demand for risk assets.
