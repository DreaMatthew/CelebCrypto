    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe flip-flopping nature of the crypto market is on full display as the sentiment on social media has changed from \"it's so over\" to \"we are so back\" in just 24 hours, thanks to President Donald Trump naming BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and ADA as candidates for the long-promised strategic crypto reserve.\n\nThe announcement has lifted valuations across the board, with market leader bitcoin reinstating $89,000 and $91,000 as key support levels, and the options market shows renewed interest in the $100K bets.\n\nStill, some analysts are calling for caution. \"Crypto is back on track with a positive momentum and enthusiasm from investors. However, it's important to note that no concrete actions have been taken yet, and a continued lack of immediate catalysts could lead to another slowly correcting market,\" Valentin Fournier, analyst at BRN, said in an email.\n\nThat's sensible because tough questions may be asked once the initial excitement about the announcement subsides. For instance, Trump still needs congressional approval for this basket of reserves. While BTC makes sense as a reserve asset, having reportedly found a place in investor portfolios as digital gold, including XRP, ETH, SOL, and ADA raises concerns, as some of these tokens barely have links to economic activity.\n\nIt begs the question: Why would a government facing debt issues invest in assets with minimal ties to the economy and are unlikely to generate a significant multiplier effect and help improve debt-to-GDP ratios?\n\nPlus, allegations of insider trading related to Trump's Sunday announcement might dent sentiment. On Sunday, an unidentified trader deployed roughly $6 million in a 50x leveraged long bet on BTC and ETH and booked out with a profit of $6.8 million. \"A U.S. crypto reserve could be a great boon to the asset class, but investors may feel more confident if significant measures are taken to resolve the fear of insider meddling,\" Mena Theodorou, co-founder at crypto exchange Coinstash, said, referring to the alleged insider trading.\n\nFor now, it's risk-on, and a similar positive action on Wall Street could see solid gains in XRP/BTC, SOL/BTC and ADA/BTC crosses. Solana's co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, also known as Toly, has reportedly expressed support for the SIMD-0228 proposal, which seeks to reform Solana’s staking mechanism to reduce inflation.\n\nWe can expect more details about the proposed reserve at Friday's crypto summit at the White House. In the meantime, two other key events to watch are Wednesday's U.S. ISM non-manufacturing (services) PMI and Friday's payrolls report.\n\nNote that the U.S. 10-year yield has declined for seven straight weeks, largely pricing a slowdown in the economy. The focus might shift back to that if the two impending data sets print below estimates, potentially weighing over risk assets.\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
