The shares dropped 1.3% to $294.30 in early trading, after rising 8.4% on Thursday.\n\nWall Street may be underestimating the company's prospects, JMP said.\n\n\"You ain't seen nothing yet,\" analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote, and if the \"transaction pace continues, 1Q25 revenues would exceed current Street consensus by nearly 30%.\"\n\nThere is a \"seismic shift\" happening in the industry, the report said, and the crypto exchange's positive momentum doesn't reflect some of the changes that are still yet to come.\n\nJMP expects huge growth for Coinbase and estimates that the company will be multiples of its current size in the coming five years.\n\n\"The regulatory and legislative backdrop is now supportive for the next chapter of crypto,\" the report added.\n\nRead more: Coinbase Posts $2.27B in Q4 Revenue, Blowing Through $1.84B Estimate",
