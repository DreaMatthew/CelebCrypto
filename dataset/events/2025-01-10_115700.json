    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe crypto market has regained some stability, with BTC rising back to nearly $95K as order books signaled the presence of bargain hunters. Late Wednesday, prices tested the long-standing support zone of $90K-$93K, which has successfully halted downward movements at least six times since the second half of November.\n\nThis latest bounce will be tested by Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which is anticipated to show an addition of 164,000 jobs in December, following November's gain of 227,000, per FXStreet. The unemployment rate is expected to match November's pace of 4.2%, while average hourly earnings are projected to cool slightly to 0.3% month-on-month, down from 0.4%.\n\nA stronger-than-expected jobs report could add to the existing hawkish Fed fears, further increasing inflation-adjusted bond yields. These yields have been rising due to inflation worries, complicating matters for risk assets. The inflation scare and rates volatility likely catalyzed BTC's rapid descent from $102K to $93K in the past four days.\n\nTo illustrate just how bearish sentiment was early today, the funding rate in perpetual markets turned negative, representing a dominance of shorts, that too at a time when BTC is just 15% away from its record high.\n\nThe prevalence of the Fed-led pessimism means any sign of weakness in the payrolls figure will likely trigger sharp market reactions, reviving the case for Fed rate cuts and shifting sentiment markedly in favor of risk assets. If the data misses estimates by a wide margin, BTC could easily make another attempt at $100K, provided the U.S. government, which holds approximately $18.50 billion worth of BTC, refrains from flooding the market with offers to sell. Stay alert.\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nU.S. exchanges were closed on Jan.9 in a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter, who passed away on December 29, 2024.\n\nThe ETF data below is from Jan.8 and remains unchanged.\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
