The nation has some 1,600 in use, up from just 23 in 2019, AUSTRAC said.\n\nA task force set up in December \"identified worrying trends and indicators of suspicious activity, including transactions that may be linked to scams or fraud,” CEO Brendan Thomas said.\n\nThe watchdog has been following in the footsteps of U.K. regulators in trying to clamp down on illegal crypto ATM activity. In the U.K. only approved crypto ATMS can operate, and none have been. The Financial Conduct Authority last month secured a four year sentence against Olumide Osunkoya, 46, for illegally operating a crypto ATM network.",
