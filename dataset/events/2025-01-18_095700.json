    "content": "Top-performing crypto majors XRP and ether\nETH\n$3,495.36\nsaw profit taking early Saturday as a Donald Trump-themed “official” memecoin attracted $3 billion in its first few hours after being issued on the Solana network, driving demand for SOL tokens.\n\nPrice-action in bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nand most majors, such as\nDOGE\n$0.1619\nand BNB Chain’s BNB, remained muted as the TRUMP token shifted sentiment for XRP and ETH. Traders perceived the Trump memecoin’s choice of issuing the token on Solana as bearish for Ethereum.\n\nAn “official” token linked to Trump was issued in early Asian hours Saturday from his verified X and Truth Social accounts. Prices ran from a few cents to $14 in less than six hours amid widespread confusion on whether the token was backed by Trump, as reported.\n\nSome fund managers consider the move to be bullish for memecoins: “The incoming President just gave everyone license to launch a memecoin - $SOL is getting the message, buckle up,” Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder VC, wrote on X.",
