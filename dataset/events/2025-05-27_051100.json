    "content": "This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nBitcoin's\nBTC\n$101,754.63\nbull run has stalled, with emerging technical signals pointing to a possible price pullback.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency by market value traded near $108,000 at press time, probing the bullish trendline, characterizing the sharp rise from $75K to record highs over $110K, TradingView data show.\n\nThere has been little bullish action in the past 24 hours despite reports that the Trump family media company plans to raise $3b billion to buy cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nA key momentum indicator called the 30-day rate of change (ROC), which measures the percentage increase or decrease in bitcoin's price over the past month, has chalked out a \"bearish divergence.\"\n\nThe bearish pattern happens when an asset's price rises, but momentum indicators like the 30-day rate of change (ROC) fail to confirm the same, hinting at potential weakness and price correction.\n\nAlthough bitcoin remains within a bullish upward channel, the 30-day ROC is forming lower highs, signaling a bearish divergence and weakening momentum.\n\nAdditionally, the daily chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, an indicator widely used to gauge trend strength and changes, has flipped negative, indicating a bearish shift in momentum.\n\nAll this means that BTC could dive out of the bullish ascending channel, potentially revisiting the major psychological resistance-turned-support at $100,000.\n\nThe broader outlook remains constructive, consistent with the recent golden cross of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs).",
