McHenry was the acting Speaker of the House for a few weeks in 2023 after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted.\n\n“For too long, D.C. has created barriers for startups and emerging companies. It’s time to level the playing field and ensure that Little Tech – the next generation of builders – gets a fair shot. As a policy maker, I promoted solutions that removed bureaucratic barriers for American entrepreneurs. At [a16z] I am eager to continue that work and ensure policymakers understand why innovation needs room to thrive,” McHenry wrote.\n\nMcHenry spent the last few years of his 20-year career in Congress advocating for the crypto industry and building a foundation for a long-awaited crypto regulatory framework. He co-sponsored the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) — a market structure bill that, if passed, would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) more power to oversee the crypto industry. He also worked with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) on bipartisan stablecoin legislation.\n\nRead more: Patrick McHenry, the Lawmaker Who Built a Foundation for U.S. Crypto Legislation\n\nEarlier this month, McHenry joined payments giant Stripe as a senior advisor.\n\nA16z was one of the largest funders of crypto-friendly super PAC Fairshake in the last election cycle, contributing approximately $70 million. It's already dedicated $116 million for the next election cycle.",
