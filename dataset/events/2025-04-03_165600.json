    "summary": "Dogecoin experienced a 12.7% price swing as technical indicators point to critical support levels amid recovery attempts",
    "content": "In the last 100 minutes of trading, DOGE has demonstrated a notable recovery pattern, climbing from a local bottom of $0.156 to stabilize around $0.158.\n\nThe price action shows an apparent V-shaped recovery with significant volume spikes (16-21 million) during the bottoming process around 14:50-14:52, indicating strong buyer interest at support levels.\n\nThe $0.158-$0.159 zone has emerged as immediate potential resistance, with multiple tests showing decreasing selling pressure. This recovery aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent decline, suggesting potential continuation toward the 50% retracement at $0.160 if current momentum persists.\n\nDisclaimer: This article was generated with AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
