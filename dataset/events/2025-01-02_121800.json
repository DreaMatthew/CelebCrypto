    "content": "Infrastructure providers, such as Northern Data (NB2), are well positioned to benefit from the growing demand from artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) firms, broker Canaccord Genuity said in a report Thursday initiating coverage of the stock.\n\nCanaccord assumed coverage of the shares with a buy rating and a 60 euro ($62) price target. The stock was trading 2.4% higher at 45.65 euros at publication time.\n\nCompanies like Northern Data are \"building the railroad for the AI gold rush,\" analysts led by Kingsley Crane said. The company's Taiga Cloud business has come online at the \"forefront of what is shaping up to be a generational opportunity.\"\n\nThe broker noted that Northern Data, which is 52% owned by stablecoin issuer Tether, has already announced it was exploring options to sell its Peak Mining business.\n\nA potential divestiture would give Northern Data cash to invest in GPUs and data-center facilities, and would \"meaningfully improve the company's growth runway beyond FY25,\" the report said.\n\nThe shares still offer potential upside despite the 74% rally in the last three months, Canaccord said, adding that \"investor appetite is evident.\"\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Miner Northern Data Moves to Dismiss Ex-Employees' Whistleblower Suit",
