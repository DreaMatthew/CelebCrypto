    "content": "Binance Coin\nBNB\n$943.68\ndropped nearly 4% over the past 24 hours, rattled by renewed global trade tensions and broad market volatility that overshadowed positive regulatory news.\n\nThe token fell from $672.53 to a low of $646.27, with selling accelerating during high-volume trading hours as traders reacted to macroeconomic developments.\n\nNews Background\n\nTechnically, BNB established a high-volume resistance zone around $669.68 after repeated failures to sustain bullish momentum. A second wave of selling hit during the midnight hour, with volume spiking to 81,409 units as prices broke below the $650 support level. Although BNB has managed a modest recovery from its cycle lows, forming potential support between $646-$648, the overall trend remains bearish with lower highs and lower lows.\n\nTechnical Analysis Recap\n\nAs global trade tensions weigh on risk assets, BNB’s resilience will be tested as traders weigh regulatory clarity against macroeconomic headwinds.",
