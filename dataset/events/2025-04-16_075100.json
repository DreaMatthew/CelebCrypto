    "content": "Bitcoin\nBTC\n$101,998.62\nand major cryptocurrencies fell over 3% as profit-taking followed Tuesday's rally.\n\nOverall crypto market capitalization fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding to nearly $83,500 from a high above $84,200 a day earlier. Ether\nETH\n$3,341.49\nand Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 5% to lead losses among majors.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market added 8% over 7 days, stabilising at the $2.7 trillion level since Saturday.\n\nFxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich says a move higher could bolster hopes for further gains, but these expectations will “only be confirmed after a solid consolidation above the 200-day moving average, which is now near $2.97 trillion.“\n\n\"Bitcoin continues its cautious rise, trading above its 50-day moving average and reaching $85,700. This is an important technical attempt to reverse the downtrend. Interestingly, the 200-day average is quite close, so a second confirmation of a trend change could come quite quickly,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that bitcoin had entered a resistance accumulation zone where the “strength of the initial rebound may fade.”\n\nSolana’s SOL is showing strength in a downtrodden market, making it ripe for a move higher if overall conditions improve.\n\n“Solana is recovering faster than many of the major altcoins, trading at its 50-day moving average near $130. A consolidation above this level will open the way to $145, the area of previous peaks. A sustained move above them will signal a break of the downtrend and could lead to a move towards $180,” Kuptsikevich noted.\n\nOn a more pessimistic approach, prominent market chartist Peter Brandt is not optimistic about bitcoin setting new highs in the current cycle.\n\n“A trendline violation does NOT signify a transition of trend BTC Sorry,” the trader noted said in an X post in response to sentiment for a bullish rebound.\n\nTrendlines are a subjective price-action analyst method and less dependable than moving averages or key levels. A break, used in tandem with technical analysis, could hint at a change in movement.\n\nHere’s what AI-driven market insights for some majors look like on Wednesday.",
