    "content": "Crypto lender Nexo said it is reentering the U.S., marking a comeback two years after regulatory friction forced its exit.\n\n\"America is back and so is Nexo,\" Co-founder Antoni Trenchev said at a press event Sunday in Bulgaria with Donald Trump Jr., crediting what he described as a more favorable environment for innovation under the Trump presidency.\n\n\"Thanks to the vision and leadership of President Donald J. Trump, his administration, and his family, the United States is once again a place where innovation is championed, not stifled. A place where pioneers are celebrated,\" Trenchev said, according to a press release.\n\nNow managing $11 billion in assets, Nexo said it will offer its full suite of services to U.S. retail and institutional clients, including high-yield savings products, asset-backed credit lines, and advanced trading solutions.\n\nNexo withdrew from the U.S. in late 2022 after what it called a \"dead end\" in negotiations with state and federal regulators over its Earn Interest Product, as well as the market turmoil following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and a wider crackdown on crypto lenders, CoinDesk reported at the time.\n\nThe company said in 2022 it could no longer operate in an \"impossible environment\" following multiple enforcement actions, including from California and New York.",
