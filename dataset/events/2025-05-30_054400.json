    "content": "James Wynn, the Hyperliquid trader who had at one time a billion-dollar notional position, has become an outsized victim of bitcoin's\nBTC\n$101,723.18\ncooling sentiment.\n\nWynn's current highly leveraged BTC position, which he appears to be struggling to maintain, spiralled into a loss of nearly $100 million over the last week.\n\nData from Hyperdash shows that Wynn's margin usage is nearing 100%, which would result in a total liquidation of his position, though Wynn recently made a deposit of $376,000 to bolster his defenses.\n\nThe trader, known for making aggressive bets under the pseudonym \"moonpig,\" currently holds a long position of approximately 1,690 BTC, valued at roughly $178.78 million.\n\nOn-chain data shows that Wynn's 40x leveraged BTC bets now carry an unrealized loss of approximately $3.5 million, representing a negative return of 77%.\n\nBut with BTC trading near $106,000, just slightly above Wynn’s liquidation price of around $104,607, any further decline in the asset’s price could trigger automatic forced sales.",
