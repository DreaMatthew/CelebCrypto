The average purchase price for MSTR's total stack is $64,459 each.\n\nThis latest acquisition was funded through proceeds from the company's two at-the-market stock offerings, the filing noted. Between April 21 and April 27, Strategy sold over $4 million worth of its Class A common stock and more than 435,000 shares of its preferred stock series, STRK.\nAccording to the 8-K filing, only $128.7 million of the common stock ATM program remains, representing just 0.6% of the initial $21 billion that began in October 2024.\n\nShares of MSTR are up 1.5% in pre-market trading alongside a modest rise in the price of bitcoin since Friday afternoon.",
