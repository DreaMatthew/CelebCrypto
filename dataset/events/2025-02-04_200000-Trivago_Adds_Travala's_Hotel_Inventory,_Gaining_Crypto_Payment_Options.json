    "content": "Travala, the travel website that accepts payments in cryptocurrency, has teamed up with trivago (TRVG), adding its inventory of 2.2 million properties to the hotel search platform.\n\nWhen trivago users select a Travala hotel they will be redirected to the website, where they will have the option of paying in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and dozens of other cryptocurrencies, the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nTravala has already secured similar tie-ups with travel search sites Skyscanner in September last year and Kayak in November 2023. The agreement with trivago adds to the real-world uses for cryptocurrencies, with hotel bookings now available as well as payments for flights.\n\nThe Singapore-based platform founded in 2017 also allows users to earn rewards in bitcoin or Travala's native token AVA, which has dropped more than 50% this year after touching a three-year high of more than $3 on Dec. 13.\n\nTravala, which is backed by the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance, is in talks with potential buyers after receiving a takeover approach late last year, CoinDesk reported last month.\n\nKayak-owner Booking.com (BKNG) was one previous suitor that decided to pass on a potential acquisition, two people with knowledge of the matter said.",
