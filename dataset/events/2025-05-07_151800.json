    "content": "Institutional funds currently hold about 3.3 million ether (ETH), or roughly 3% of the circulating supply, through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With 27% of ETH already staked, these ETF holdings alone could increase the amount of total staked ETH by more than 10%. And that’s without factoring in additional inflows from investors drawn to the promise of earning staking yield inside an ETF wrapper. The question now therefore isn’t can institutions stake: it’s when and how they’ll do it.\n\nThat “how” matters, however: if ETH ETF staking is approved, issuers may default to third-party operators or route staking through a handful of custodians. This could result in validator power concentrating quickly, especially considering current custody providers, creating centralized entities. Lido still leads with over 30% of staked ETH, but under the hood there are more than 500 operators with the inception of Community Staking Module last year. But if a wave of institutional ETH money flows into just a few trusted intermediaries, Ethereum risks drifting toward a validator oligopoly on centralized operators.\n\nThis chart shows the total ETH held by ETFs in purple, which would be the second largest staker as a category, and in orange the top three ETFs holding ETH. TVL= total value locked.\n\nOn the flip side, there’s a rare opportunity for ETF issuers to go direct, running their own nodes.\n\nVertical integration into staking infrastructure allows issuers to both decentralize the network and unlock economic upside. The standard validator fee — typically 5–15% of staking rewards — is currently captured by operators and the liquid staking protocol managing the staking pools, such as Lido, RocketPool and even the centralized wallet exchanges pools.\n\nHowever, if ETF managers run their own nodes or partner with independent providers, they can reclaim that margin and boost fund performance. In an industry competing on basis points, that edge matters. We’re already seeing an M&A trend underway. Bitwise’s acquisition of a staking operator is no coincidence: it’s a signal that smart asset managers are positioning for a future where staking isn’t just a back-end service but a core part of the fund’s value chain.\n\nThis development represents Ethereum’s fork in the road, in which institutions can either treat staking as a plug-and-play checkbox, reinforcing centralization and systemic risk, or they can help build a more credibly neutral protocol by distributing operations across validators.\n\nWith a short queue, an expanding set of validators and billions of ETH sitting idle, the timing couldn’t be better. So as the institutionalization of staking looks increasingly likely, let’s make sure it’s done right, reinforcing the foundations of what blockchain is all about.",
