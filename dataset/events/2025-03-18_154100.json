    "summary": "The filing comes as 21Shares expands its crypto ETF offerings, including funds for XRP and Solana.",
    "content": "Nasdaq officially asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow Swiss asset manager 21Shares list and trade shares of a polkadot (DOT) exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe exchange submitted a 19b-4 filing to the SEC, asking for permission to list the ETF if it is approved by the regulator.\n\nThe proposed fund would track the spot price of DOT, the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network. The filing follows an amended S-1 form submitted by 21Shares earlier this year, marking another step in the firm’s push to bring more crypto investment products to the market.\n\n21Shares is also seeking regulatory approval for funds linked to XRP and solana's SOL. The company recently announced it’s set to liquidate two actively managed crypto ETFs amid the market downturn.\n\nGrayscale Investments, a crypto asset-management company, has also filed with the SEC to launch a Polkadot ETF, signaling broader interest in the asset.",
