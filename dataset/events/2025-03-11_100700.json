    "content": "The consumer price index (CPI) report due Wednesday will be the first under President Donald Trump's tenure, with signs of cooling likely to raise the chance of an interest-rate cut and lift the spirits of investors in risk assets, who have been hammered in recent weeks.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is forecast to say headline inflation declined year-over-year to 2.9% from 3%, while core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, also lost 0.1 percentage point to 3.2%.\n\nSlower inflation raises the chance of an interest-rate cut, making riskier investments more attractive. CPI, which measures the cost of a basket of goods and services across the U.S. economy, has accelerated for four consecutive months.\n\nIn the past few weeks, the S&P 500 has dropped almost 10% from its all-time high and bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,347.87\nhas lost around 30% to around $80,000.\n\nBoth Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have emphasized the need for lower 10-year Treasury yields to bring down the federal funds rate. So far, this strategy appears to be working, with the 10-year yield falling to 4.2% from 4.8%, the dollar index (DXY) weakening below 104 and WTI crude oil stabilizing in the mid-$60 range — aligning with the administration's economic plans.\n\nMeanwhile, the Truflation Index has hit 1.35%, its lowest level since September 2020. However, five- and 10-year inflation expectations remain above 2%, indicating that Trump still has work to do in managing long-term inflation expectations.\n\nAt the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 18-19, Chair Jerome Powell is expected to hold the federal funds rate steady at 4.25%-4.50%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching the inflation report, as a cooler-than-expected print could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider rate cuts. Conversely, a \"hot\" inflation reading would likely keep rates higher for longer and put further pressure on risk assets.",
