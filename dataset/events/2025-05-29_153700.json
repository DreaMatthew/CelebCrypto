    "content": "Bitget Wallet, a non-custodial crypto wallet, has partnered with payments platform Coinpal to make it easier for users to spend digital assets across a wide range of online retailers.\n\nThe move connects Bitget Wallet users to over 6,000 merchants already working with Coinpal, which include businesses in gaming, electronics, fashion and software.\n\nThis partnership also brings Coinpal in as a channel partner for Paydify, Bitget Wallet’s decentralized payments infrastructure. Paydify enables crypto payments through QR codes and APIs, settling transactions in stablecoins instantly. The system aims to simplify crypto acceptance for merchants.\n\nBitget Wallet’s latest tools are part of a broader push to make crypto usable beyond speculation. Users can now pay via a ‘Scan to Pay’ feature and upcoming updates will allow integration with Solana Pay and national QR code systems in select countries — converting crypto to local currencies automatically and at low cost.\n\n“Our work with Coinpal makes crypto payments more accessible,” said Bitget Wallet COO Alvin Kan. “We’re building tools that help people spend their assets in the real world.”\n\nBitget Wallet plans to expand this payment system into physical retail settings to further grow its ecosystem.",
