    "content": "Crypto exchange Crypto.com said it bought AN Allnew Investments to gain a license allowing it to offer derivatives across the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\nThe Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license was issued to Allnew by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), the exchange said in a website posting. It grants the exchange the right to offer a range of financial products in the 27 nations of the European Union alongside Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nThis acquisition bolsters Crypto.com's presence in Europe. The exchange secured a Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license in January so it could offer crypto custody and exchange services across the EEA. The company declined to say how much it paid for Allnews.\n\nCrypto exchanges have been moving into derivatives to unlock new sources of profit. The company joins rivals including Gemini and Kraken in gaining MiFID licenses to offer derivatives in Europe. Kraken's license was also obtained through acquisition of the holder. Earlier this month, Coinbase spent $2.9 billion to buy options platform Deribit to strengthen its position in the U.S. derivatives market.",
