    "content": "Bitcoin's\nBTC\n$104,608.94\nrally is gaining momentum, with institutions stepping up their exposure to the leading cryptocurrency through Deribit's BTC options market.\n\n\"Panning out over just the last week shows a much bigger sign of institutional positioning on BTC,\" Deribit said on X Friday, noting the bullish flows in the BTC options.\n\nThe exchange has seen robust buying of call options at the $110,000 strike expiring in June and July and calendar spreads involving a long position in the $140,000 strike call expiring at the end of September and a short position in the $170,000 strike call expiring at the end of the year.\n\nThe demand for the $110,000 strike call indicates expectations for a continued price rise in the coming weeks, with potential for an extended rise to at least $140,000.\n\nA call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.\n\nThe exchange added that the bullish flows also included a roll over of long positions in May expiry to July expiries at strikes ranging from $110,000 to $115,000.\n\nCoinDesk data show BTC topped $104,000 Thursday, marking a near 40% recovery from the early April lows under $75,000, amid optimism from the U.S.-U.K. trade deal and consistent inflows into the spot ETFs. Technical charts point to more gains ahead.\n\nEther, the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, has risen over 30% to $2,411 in two days, marking a bullish breakout on technical charts. The development has triggered interest in bullish ETH plays on Deribit, with traders snapping up the June expiry calls at $2,400 and longer duration call spreads betting on gains up to $2,600-$2,800.",
