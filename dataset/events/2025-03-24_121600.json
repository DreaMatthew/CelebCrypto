    "summary": "History suggests the gap, located in the $84,000–$85,000 range, is likely to be filled.",
    "content": "As spot Bitcoin (BTC) pushed higher over the weekend reaching a high of $87,800 on Monday, another gap emerged between CME futures' closing price on Friday and the start of the new week's trading.\n\nThe futures closed at $84,190 at the end of the last week and opened about $1,000 higher at $85,160. That sets the stage for a drop back because bitcoin has developed a tendency to fill these CME futures gaps.\n\nAs of mid-March, it had filled the most recent gap, which was created during the November rally following President Donald Trump’s election victory. That gap was fully closed when bitcoin dropped to $76,700 in mid-March.\n\nThe gaps occur because spot bitcoin trades 24/7 while CME futures operate only 23 hours a day, Sunday through Friday. When there’s a significant price movement during the CME’s off-hours, a gap forms between the previous close and the next day’s open.\n\nHistorically, bitcoin has often retraced to fill such gaps. Based on this pattern, it’s likely that bitcoin could revisit the $84,000–$85,000 range in the near term.",
