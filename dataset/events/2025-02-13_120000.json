    "content": "By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nAfter Wednesday’s unexpectedly high consumer price inflation (CPI) figures, all eyes now turn to the produce price report due at 8:30 a.m.\n\nAnalysts expect year-over-year PPI to come in at 3.2%, below December’s 3.3%, with a month-on-month reading of 0.3%, up from 0.2%. Core PPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is expected to show underlying inflationary pressure, accelerating to 0.3% from 0% in December. From January last year, it's seen easing to 3.3%.\n\nHotter-than-expected data could signal monetary policy remains too loose, potentially delaying or even eliminating Fed rate cuts this year, against President Trump's wishes. A more restrictive Fed is likely to be bearish for risk assets. On the other hand, softer inflation data could weaken the dollar and lower treasury yields while helping boost risk-assets.\n\nFollowing the CPI data markets were volatile.\n\nTreasury yields surged to 4.6% before retreating slightly. The Dollar Index (DXY) mirrored this movement, spiking to 108.5 before pulling back below 108.\n\nDespite the initial sell-off, major asset classes rebounded, with bitcoin (BTC), U.S. equities and gold finishing the session in the green.\n\nAlso on the agenda, Coinbase (COIN) reports fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes. Following Robinhood's strong results, expectations are high, and a positive report could provide a boost to the cryptocurrency market. Stay Alert!\n\nCoinDesk's Consensus to take place in Hong Kong on Feb. 18-20 and in Toronto on May 14-16.
