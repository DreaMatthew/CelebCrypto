    "content": "The team behind the Trump memecoin said Thursday that the top 220 holders on its list, where the smallest wallet holds $420 worth of TRUMP, are eligible to win dinner with President Donald Trump, contrary to rumors that a six-figure token stash was required.\n\n“We want to clarify a few things people seem confused by on X and in the Media,” the team’s X account posted. “You need $300K+ to participate (You Don't); That we're unlocking into this competition (We're Not).”\n\nTRUMP surged 70% this week, trading at around $12 as of Thursday, mainly driven by hype around the so-called “Dinner with Trump” event, according to CoinDesk’s earlier reporting.\n\nSome users on X claimed that only holders with more than $300,000 in tokens could participate. Others speculated that the wallet ranked 220 on a blockchain explorer was the minimum cutoff.\n\nThe team dismissed both claims, stating that users must register via the official leaderboard and that only time-weighted holdings during the competition will count.\n\nCurrently, the leaderboard's top wallet, under the pseudonym “Sun,” holds over 1.1 million TRUMP tokens, worth nearly $14 million. The 220th spot was held by “HAR,” with just 35.3 TRUMP tokens, or about $420 in dollar terms.\n\nTwenty five wallets are listed as VIPs on the leaderboard, where the cut-off holder sits on over $400,000 worth of TRUMP.\n\nThe team also addressed concerns about token unlocks affecting the leaderboard, stating that both the cliff unlock and subsequent daily unlocks would remain inaccessible for 90 days, outlasting the competition itself.\n\n“We want to say again that the tokens from the initial cliff unlock and the following 3 months of daily unlocks will remain locked, each for an additional 90 days,” it said.",
