    "summary": "The company said that the name change was a “natural evolution” given its strong focus on bitcoin.",
    "content": "MicroStrategy (MSTR) has changed its name to Strategy in a move to simplify its brand and reflect the focus of the company, it announced Wednesday.\n\nStrategy’s new logo includes the famous Bitcoin “B”, signaling the company’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, and the name's new primary color is orange.\n\n“This brand simplification is a natural evolution of the company, reflecting its focus and broad appeal,” a press release stated.\n\nMicroStrategy, founded by now-Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, was primarily a software and infrastructure company since its 1989 debut. In the past five years, however, it has gradually shifted to become primarily focused on the accumulation of bitcoin, with its operating software business only a small fraction of the company valuation.\n\nLast year, the company began calling itself a Bitcoin Strategy Company.\n\nStrategy is announcing fourth-quarter earnings results after the close on Wednesday, with analysts expecting the firm to report a net loss as it continues to hold off marking higher its bitcoin holdings.",
