    "content": "SOL Strategies (HODL), the Toronto-listed digital asset firm focusing on Solana\nSOL\n$162.61\n, said on Tuesday it has acquired over $18 million worth of SOL tokens, using proceeds from a newly secured financing deal.\n\nThe company purchased 122,524 SOL for $18.25 million at an average price of $148.96 per token, according to a press release. The acquisition follows the initial $20 million closing of a planned $500 million convertible note facility with investment firm ATW Partners, announced last month.\n\nShares of the company slid 10% to around CA$2.6 in the early Tuesday hours of the session, extending the slump for late April's peak over CA$3.3. Still, the stock is up nearly 80% in two weeks.\n\n\"With the closing of our initial $20 million tranche from the ATW facility, we’re executing exactly as promised – strategically acquiring SOL to expand our validator operations and ecosystem position,\" said CEO Leah Wald. \"These purchases directly strengthen our three-pillar strategy of enterprise grade validators, strategic SOL holdings, and solana technology innovation.\"\n\nValidator operations are core infrastructure in proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana, where participants help secure the network and earn staking rewards. By acquiring SOL, the firm can increase its validator stake, potentially boosting both influence and revenue within the ecosystem.\n\nSol Strategies' move highlights a growing trend among public companies applying the playbook of Michael Saylor's Strategy with bitcoin\nBTC\n$104,608.94\n—using capital markets to accumulate large cryptocurrency holdings in the hopes delivering upside to shareholders.\n\nLast month, real estate fintech firm Janover (JNVR), now rebranded as DeFi Development, pivoted to focusing on accumulating SOL and building out a validator business on the Solana network.\n\nRead more: DeFi Development Plans to Raise $1 Billion to Buy More Solana\n\nDisclaimer: This article, or parts of it, was generated with assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
