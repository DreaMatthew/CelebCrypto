    "content": "ATME, a digital assets exchange licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), said on Tuesday it has completed its first tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuance starting with gold-backed tokens.\n\nThe tokens, available to accredited investors, each represent one kilogram of gold stored in custody, according to the press release. Investors can trade these digital assets on ATME’s secondary market or redeem them for physical gold. The initiative aims to modernize gold ownership by eliminating storage and transportation concerns while leveraging blockchain for efficiency and security.\n\nRead more: Tokenization Allows More Efficient Collateral Transfers, Digital Asset, Euroclear and World Gold Council Found in Pilot Project\n\n“By combining the timeless value of gold with blockchain technology, we are unlocking new ways for investors to access and trade high-value assets,” Alex Lola, CEO of ATME, said in a statement.\n\nThe exchange said it plans to expand its offerings to include other asset classes, further integrating blockchain technology into traditional financial systems.\n\nATME’s tokenized gold offering aligns with a broader trend in financial markets where real-world assets such as commodities, bonds and funds are increasingly being digitized and traded on blockchain rails, a process also known as tokenization. The market of tokenized gold is worth around $1.2 billion, dominated by Paxos-issued PAXG and stablecoin issuer Tether's XAUT tokens, rwa.xyz data shows. Global bank HSBC also introduced a gold token in Hong Kong for retail investors last year, signaling broader adoption.\n\nGold-backed tokens enjoyed a resurgence in activity recently as gold prices hit fresh record highs propelled by a weaker dollar, mounting trade war worries and geopolitical turmoil.",
