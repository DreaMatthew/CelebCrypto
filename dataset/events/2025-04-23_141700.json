    "content": "Rice Robotics and dog-themed utility project Floki will soon launch the Minibot M1, a Floki-branded AI-powered companion robot that works on the RICE AI platform.\n\nFloki will support the company in its blockchain push as it moves towards tokenizing its brand and AI data marketplace through TokenFi, a Floki sister project focused on tokenizing real-world assets, with support from the Floki community.\n\n“The AI robotics market size is currently worth an estimated $22 billion and is projected to reach $100 billion by 2030, and we believe Rice Robotics is well-positioned for growth in this high-potential industry,” the Floki team told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.\n\nRICE AI is a robotics brand with high-profile clients such as Nvidia, Softbank, Dubai Future Foundation, Mitsui Fudosan, NTT Japan, and 7-Eleven. It raised over $7 million in a pre-Series A funding round earlier this year from investors including Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, Soul Capital and Audacy Ventures.\n\nRICE AI wants to make robots smarter by creating a system where robots worldwide can buy and share top-notch training data. These robots work independently without central control, making them more useful in the real world.\n\nFLOKI prices are up 16% in the past 24 hours alongside a broader crypto market bump.",
