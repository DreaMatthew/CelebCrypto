    "content": "This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\n\nBitcoin's\nBTC\n$101,998.62\nrecent range play resolved bullishly early Monday, shifting focus to the $90,000-$92,000 range, which was previously a strong support zone.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrency by market value rose past $87,000, convincingly breaking out of a week-long consolidation between $83,000 and $86,000. The renewed willingness among the bulls to lead the price action indicates the resumption of the recovery from the April 7 lows under $75,000.\n\nIt also means potential for a continued move higher to the $90,000-$92,000 range, which acted as the floor, arresting price drops from December to early February. The support zone was eventually breached in late February, spurring a rapid decline to under $75,000.\n\nThe range breakout is seen on the hourly chart (left).\n\nIt follows the recent invalidation of the bearish trendline, characterizing the sell-off from record highs, as seen on the daily chart. BTC has also surpassed the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of price highs, indicating a bullish shift in momentum.\n\nThe focus, therefore, is on the $90,000-$92,000 range, the former support zone from early this year. Those tracking moving averages should note that the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) is now located at $88,245.\n\nThe bullish outlook risks invalidation should prices fall all the way back to $85K by the day's end (UTC).\n\nMarkets tend to revisit breakout points before staging bigger rallies, meaning BTC could revisit $86K – more so, as the breakout happened during the early Asian hours when the liquidity tends to be weak, allowing few orders to have an outsized impact on the spot prices.\n\n11:25 UTC: Adds comments about volume and pullback risks in the last para.",
