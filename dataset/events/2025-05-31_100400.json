    "content": "Solana\nSOL\n$157.11\nfell more than 5% over the past 24 hours, rattled by geopolitical tensions and waning memecoin activity on its network.\nThe token dropped from $163.72 to a low of $154.99 as a combination of market uncertainty and declining network revenue put pressure on its price.\n\nThe decline coincides with a broader crypto market correction triggered by the U.S. Court of International Trade’s reversal on Trump’s tariff suspension, which reignited trade concerns and spooked investors.\nMemecoin revenue from the once-popular Pump.fun platform has also nosedived since early April, weakening one of Solana’s key transaction drivers.\n\nNews Background\n\nPrice-Action\nTechnical analysis shows SOL forming a double-top pattern near $184.50, breaking below key Fibonacci support levels.\n\nThe SOL/ETH trading pair also collapsed below a rising wedge, with some analysts warning of a potential 40% drop relative to Ethereum if network activity fails to recover.\n\nStandard Chartered added to the caution, suggesting that unless Solana can diversify beyond memecoins, its price could continue to underperform. Meanwhile, long liquidations have increased, contributing to the bearish pressure.\n\nDespite these headwinds, some traders remain optimistic, noting that SOL is still within a broader bullish structure if it can hold the $150-$160 support range.\n\nA sustained hold at these levels could pave the way for a potential recovery toward $200, though failure to do so may trigger further declines toward lower support zones.\n\nTechnical Analysis Recap\n\nAs traders weigh Solana’s next move, the market will be watching closely to see if the token can hold above critical support levels or if bearish momentum will push prices lower.",
