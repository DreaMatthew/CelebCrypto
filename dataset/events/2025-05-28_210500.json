    "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose roughly 4% in post-trading hours after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue on Wednesday.\n\nThe AI powerhouse posted a 69% increase in revenue in the first quarter, compared to a year ago, with its data center business growing 73% year-over-year. Net income came in at $18.8 billion, up 26% from a year earlier.\n\nThe after-hours move pushed NVDA shares to a modest year-to-date gain and about a 20% year-over-year advance.\n\nAI crypto tokens, including Bittensor\nTAO\n$391.72\n, NEAR Protocol\nNEAR\n$1.8557\nand Internet Computer (CIP), moved slightly higher after Nvidia’s earnings beat, although remained sizably lower for the day. Nevertheless, it was ongoing AI demand which was a key driver in the 73% growth in the company data center business.\n\nTurning to the outlook amid recent global trade uncertainties, Nvidia said it expects second-quarter revenue to come in below market estimates as a result of tariff-related restrictions between the U.S. and China.",
