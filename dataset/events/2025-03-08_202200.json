    "content": "Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor shared a comprehensive cryptocurrency strategy at the White House Digital Assets Summit, arguing that the U.S. can unlock up to $100 trillion in economic value over the next decade by establishing a clear regulatory framework, removing barriers to innovation, and strategically acquiring bitcoin.\n\nSaylor outlined a structured approach to these assets, categorizing them into four distinct classes: digital tokens for capital creation and innovation, digital securities for market efficiency, digital currencies for commercial and to strengthen the dollar’s global position and digital commodities like bitcoin for wealth preservation.\n\nIn his proposal, Saylor argued that this taxonomy would reduce regulatory uncertainty and integrate digital assets seamlessly into the traditional financial system. His proposal calls for the removal of restrictions on cryptocurrencies, which would allow entities in the U.S. quick access to capital markets while ensuring the U.S. dollar would remain integral to global commerce.\n\nThe first-ever White House Crypto Summit, held on Friday, was largely meant to set a tone for the Trump administration's friendlier stance on the industry compared to the former administration of President Joe Biden. The summit included a wide range of industry giants, including top executives of Coinbase, Ripple, Strategy, Kraken, Gemini, Chainlink, Robinhood and many others.\n\nRead more: CoinDeskTrump's Crypto Summit Sets Agenda for U.S. Pivot\n\nAt the same time, Saylor’s proposal emphasized the need for fair disclosure and accountability to prevent fraud and conflicts of interest. Strategy’s founder also called for ending “hostile and unfair tax policies” on the crypto sector. Instead, government support would allow the industry to “reach its full potential.”\n\n“The government should encourage and provide support for major banks to custody, trade, and finance bitcoin assets. Debanking of crypto industry participants should not be tolerated,” the proposal reads.\n\nA central pillar of Saylor’s vision is a strategic bitcoin reserve, which would see the U.S. acquire 5%-25% of the total bitcoin supply by 2035 through steady, programmatic purchases. Strategy, the firm Saylor founded and in which he currently serves as executive chairman, adopted bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in 2020, having purchased 499,096 BTC since.\n\nHe projected that by 2045, this reserve could generate between $16 to $81 trillion, offering a long-term solution for national debt reduction for the U.S.\n\nRead more: Strategy Has Taken 30% of the U.S. Convertible Debt Market in 2025",
