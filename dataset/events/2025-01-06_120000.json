    "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\n\nThe overture to 2025 has a familiar tune. It's not just the numbers: Bitcoin's 8% recovery from late December, but the news flow is equally recognizable.\n\nPerhaps the most important note comes from JPMorgan, which says the market forces that drove bitcoin and gold to records last year are still around.\n\n\"The debasement trade is here to stay, with both gold and Bitcoin becoming increasingly important components of investors' portfolios,\" the investment bank wrote.\n\nThe debasement trade is a strategy where investors buy assets that protect against declines in fiat currencies and government bonds due to inflation and policy shifts.\n\nLast year's debasement play drove bitcoin above $100,000 — a figure it's approaching again — and gold over $2,600. The rallies were fueled by increased geopolitical uncertainty, persistent inflation concerns, debt debasement in advanced economies, fears of fiat currency devaluation in emerging markets and a shift away from the U.S. dollar. Coupled with President-elect Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance, this led to a record $78 billion in net inflows into the digital assets market, according to JPMorgan.\n\nAny discordant tone comes from elevated bond yields and a strong dollar driven by economic optimism and declining Fed rate-cut bets, which could limit upside potential in the short term. This Friday's nonfarm payrolls report will provide a critical test for the hawkish Fed narrative, with expectations for 154,000 job additions in December.\n\nThe shenanigans surrounding BTC-holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) deserve attention, particularly the social-media buzz about brokers reducing their exposure to the company. This reduction comes alongside significant increases in margin requirements, raising concerns about potential volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto economist Ben Lilly suggests that ether’s price has been suppressed by the growing number of coins locked up in the DeFi protocol Ethena, which shorts ETH futures as part of a delta-neutral hedge strategy to maintain the $1 peg of its stablecoin, USDe. ETH has jumped 10% in the first six days of the year but remains well below its record high.\n\n\"This suggests a shift in the market toward delta-neutral exposure on ETH instead of seeking upside by holding it as collateral. Thus, the ETH price is likely to be muted on the upside because of Ethena,\" Lilly said on X.\n\nEthena has announced plans to launch iUSDe, a version designed for institutional investors seeking exposure to yield-bearing USDe without direct token interaction. Meanwhile, the leading on-chain perp DEX exchange, Hyperliquid, has listed SOLV, the native token of the Bitcoin staking protocol Solv Protocol, and whispers are circulating about whales looking to buy up the HYPE token. Stay alert.\n\nBy Shaurya Malwa\n\nParody token\nSPX\n$0.6818\njumped another 17% in the past 24 hours to reach a $1.5 billion market capitalization, keeping a rally from last week going even as the broader market remains fairly steady.\n\nThe token started as a satire on the S&P 500 equity index and has since captured a dedicated community that hopes to one day flip the capitalization of the entire U.S. stock market, which was valued at just over $44 trillion as of Monday.\n\nA manifesto on the SPX6900 site speaks to a generation facing economic challenges, positioning the token as a \"reset\" for the stock market.\n\nThe community's rallying cry, \"stop trading and start believing in something,\" has fostered a strong, belief-driven following. This slogan encourages long-term holding over short-term trading, fostering a community of \"diamond-handed\" believers. This culture prioritizes faith in the project's potential over immediate financial gains.\n\nSpot BTC ETFs:\n\nSpot ETH ETFs\n\nSource: Farside Investors",
