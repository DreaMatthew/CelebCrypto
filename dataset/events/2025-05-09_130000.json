    "summary": "Institutions trading crypto need more than fast execution, they need tools to unlock capital and build precise strategies says Flowdesk’s U.S. CEO.",
    "content": "Market maker Flowdesk has launched an institutional credit desk, expanding its footprint in digital asset markets as traditional finance players seek more efficient ways to deploy and access capital into crypto.\n\nSophisticated institutional counterparties are seeking structured credit products to manage liquidity, hedge exposure, and generate yield across fragmented venues. Flowdesk’s new desk meets that demand by integrating lending, borrowing, and structured credit into its existing OTC and liquidity infrastructure.\n\n“Institutions trading digital assets require more than just efficient execution,” said Reed Werbitt, Flowdesk’s U.S. CEO and chief revenue officer. “They need tools to unlock capital and structure strategies with precision,” he added.\n\nThe new desk integrates lending, borrowing, and structured credit directly into Flowdesk’s OTC and liquidity services.\n\nThis rollout comes just two months after Flowdesk raised over $100 million to expand headcount and build out an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading desk.\n\n“Our mission is to deliver institutional-grade trading solutions for the digital asset ecosystem,” said Guilhem Chaumont, co-founder and Global CEO of Flowdesk in a release.\n\n“The launch of our Credit Desk is aligned with our commitment to expanding access to advanced digital asset strategies and robust risk management for a broader range of institutional counterparties,” Chaumont said.\n\nFlowdesk’s expansion comes amid increasing U.S. institutional interest in digital assets, and the White House giving the industry a regulatory green light.\n\nThe trading firm has always been quite bullish on this narrative.\n\nBack in 2023, at the height of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) war on crypto, Flowdesk made the contrarian move to expand its U.S. office even as others in the industry were looking offshore. Chaumont said at the time that the size and sophistication of U.S. capital markets made the risk worth it.",
